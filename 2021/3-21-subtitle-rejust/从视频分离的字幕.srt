1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:04,424
But before you see
Justice League I wanted to say

2
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:09,054
a huge thank you to all of the
fans that made this possible.

3
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:13,225
Your amazing and generous
support for AFSP,

4
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:18,480
...your incredible passion for
this vision that you're about

5
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,984
to get a chance to see and
that you made happen.

6
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:26,697
So on behalf of myself and
Debbie, thank you so much

7
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:30,326
and check it out,
it's streaming now.

8
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:46,702
Alert the queen.

9
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:07,682
Hyah!

10
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:40,251
Bruce Vayne.

11
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:42,002
Bruce Wayne.

12
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:01,355
Talk.

13
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,275
I believe there is a stranger.

14
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:07,069
Comes to this village
from the sea.

15
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:10,239
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

16
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:12,533
He brings fish.

17
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:14,368
He comes on the king tide.

18
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:15,578
That was last night.

19
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,587
You have eyes, so see.

20
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:26,297
Icebergs in the harbor.

21
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:29,425
It's four months since
the last ship got through.

22
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:33,971
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

23
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,440
There are enemies
coming from far away.

24
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,276
I need warriors.

25
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:51,030
This stranger, others like him.

26
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:55,367
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

27
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:58,788
It's very important
that I see this man.

28
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:01,957
If this stranger exists,

29
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:04,376
he'll give him your message.

30
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:05,711
$5,000 American.

31
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,463
Look, I'll give you $25,000

32
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:10,674
to talk to this man
right now, outside.

33
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:27,691
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

34
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:31,529
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

35
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:34,573
We are poor, not stupid.

36
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:36,408
Get out.

37
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:38,994
I'm sorry.

38
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,829
Can't do that.

39
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:43,207
I'll leave after we've spoken.

40
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:49,338
He said, "Get out."

41
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,150
Arthur Curry.

42
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:13,237
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

43
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:15,489
The Aquaman.

44
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:22,705
So, let me get this straight.

45
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:26,584
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

46
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,502
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

47
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,254
Oh, that shithole.

48
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,256
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

49
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,800
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

50
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:37,011
'Cause I don't like you coming here,
digging into my business

51
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:39,763
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.

52
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,473
Is that why you do this?

53
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,100
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?

54
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:44,435
I've read the stories.

55
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,812
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.

56
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:48,314
You'll join us.

57
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,441
"Strong man
is strongest alone."

58
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,984
You ever heard that?

59
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:53,569
You ever hear of Superman?

60
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:55,321
He died fighting next to me.

61
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:57,948
My point exactly.

62
00:12:58,115 --> 00:13:00,409
He believed
we were stronger together.

63
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:02,036
We owe it to him.

64
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:04,496
I don't owe anyone anything.

65
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:14,798
Dressed like a bat.

66
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:16,925
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.

67
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:46,557
Move over, Dusty.

68
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:45,407
My God, Master Wayne,
but this is cold.

69
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:49,995
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?

70
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,331
Might be
a metahuman or two in Fiji.

71
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:54,124
Costa Rica's nice.

72
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,793
I found him.

73
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,798
He said no.

74
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:03,300
So the draft stands
at naught for two?

75
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,305
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living

76
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:12,184
isn't cut out to be
a recruiter. Hmm?

77
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,539
That's $10, please.

78
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,881
<i>Let us go now</i>

79
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:50,139
<i>My darling companion</i>

80
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,358
<i>Set out for the</i>

81
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:09,700
<i>Distant skies...</i>

82
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:12,786
Good morning, Miss Lane.

83
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,288
Jerry, hi.

84
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:16,957
Wow.

85
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,417
You don't miss a day, do you?

86
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:21,712
Like it here.

87
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:34,600
<i>They told us our gods
would outlive us</i>

88
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:40,772
<i>They told us our dreams
would outlive us</i>

89
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:49,573
<i>They told us our gods
would outlive us</i>

90
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:56,914
<i>But they lied</i>

91
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:08,318
Excuse me.

92
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:10,988
Move!

93
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:23,375
Move it! Move it!

94
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:32,134
- No, mate, don't shoot!
- Move, move!

95
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:33,844
Get the fuck over there!

96
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,472
Move! All of ya!

97
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:49,985
Line them up along the wall.

98
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:52,696
Keep them quiet.

99
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:55,282
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!

100
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:56,867
Shut them up too!

101
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:02,414
We'll be making
a statement shortly.

102
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:04,416
Until then,
if I see any movement,

103
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,668
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.

104
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:23,185
Should I take him?

105
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:24,936
Hold your fire.

106
00:20:26,396 --> 00:20:27,606
They've got kids in there.

107
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:31,276
Yeah, he's not bluffing, chief.

108
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,695
St. Brigid's had
a school trip today.

109
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:59,429
Quiet! Shut up!

110
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:06,978
Down with the modern world.

111
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:08,688
Back to the Dark Ages.

112
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,070
Quiet!

113
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:19,783
I said shut your fucking mouth.

114
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:35,590
Who are you?

115
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:38,677
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

116
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:41,179
Now, who are you?

117
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:44,516
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists

118
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:46,101
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe

119
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:48,645
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?

120
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:50,313
We have no demands.

121
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:52,315
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.

122
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:53,859
While you do what?

123
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:57,988
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.

124
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:01,616
In a few minutes,
four city blocks...

125
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:05,996
...while the world watches.

126
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:46,763
No!

127
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:48,807
Like lambs to the slaughter.

128
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:39,482
I don't believe it.

129
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:40,775
Believe it.

130
00:25:16,102 --> 00:25:19,230
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?

131
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:21,316
Good. It's okay.

132
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,693
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.

133
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:25,028
It's all good.

134
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:27,238
It's over now.
Are you okay?

135
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:29,407
You okay? Good.

136
00:25:34,996 --> 00:25:36,373
Are you okay, princess?

137
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:41,753
Can I be like you someday?

138
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:46,383
You can be anything
you want to be.

139
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:50,804
Come on. Let's go.

140
00:26:33,513 --> 00:26:34,722
Any changes today?

141
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:36,349
No, my Queen.

142
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,894
The Mother Box has awoken,

143
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:42,981
yet nothing has happened.

144
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:45,358
It has slept
for thousands of years

145
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:47,444
since the First Age.

146
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:48,945
Why did it wake at all?

147
00:26:56,536 --> 00:26:58,580
This is the first time
it's gone quiet

148
00:26:58,663 --> 00:26:59,914
since the crack appeared.

149
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:02,876
Maybe it's going back to sleep.

150
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,757
Evil does not sleep.

151
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:11,468
It waits.

152
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:14,971
Something is coming.

153
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:21,519
Prepare for battle!

154
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:49,714
Amazons, on your marks!

155
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,216
Ready!

156
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:18,409
Defenders.

157
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:24,666
They have failed 100,000 worlds.

158
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:26,334
They always fail.

159
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,924
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.

160
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:36,094
I will bathe in your fear.

161
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:40,098
Daughters of Themyscira,

162
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:42,850
show him your fear!

163
00:28:42,976 --> 00:28:45,478
We have no fear!

164
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:06,416
Gather the legions!

165
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:08,543
Go with her!

166
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:09,919
You must seal the cage!

167
00:29:10,086 --> 00:29:12,380
- Go!
- Phillipus!

168
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,283
No!

169
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:54,005
Behind you!

170
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,177
Ahhh!

171
00:30:01,387 --> 00:30:02,472
Epione.

172
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:06,476
Honor us. It's right.

173
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:10,688
Seal it.

174
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:18,613
Ready the hammers!

175
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:32,961
Seal it now!

176
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:08,848
Guard it with your life.

177
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:10,933
- Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.

178
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:12,477
Hyah! Hyah!

179
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:37,603
Hyah!

180
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:58,643
Got it! Go!

181
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,062
Hyah!

182
00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:25,711
Oh, noble Queen.
Why do you fight?

183
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:30,466
You can't save her.

184
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:33,302
You can't save any of them.

185
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:40,601
The great darkness begins.

186
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:42,436
Amazons!

187
00:35:52,655 --> 00:35:55,491
Yes, we will find the others.

188
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,829
Draw!

189
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:03,332
Loose!

190
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:03,184
He's gone back to his universe.

191
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:04,435
No.

192
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:09,273
He's gone to the lands of men

193
00:37:09,398 --> 00:37:12,568
to find the other two boxes.

194
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:15,738
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

195
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:19,408
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

196
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:21,077
Men won't know what it means.

197
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:23,496
Men won't.

198
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:26,624
She will.

199
00:37:57,279 --> 00:37:59,949
It's toxic.

200
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:01,826
That's good.

201
00:38:22,805 --> 00:38:23,764
Go!

202
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:26,142
Follow the scent
of the Mother Boxes.

203
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:27,726
Find the missing two.

204
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:31,772
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.

205
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:34,817
This world will join the others.

206
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:38,654
He will be pleased.

207
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:41,824
He will see my worth again.

208
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,036
Hey.

209
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:49,039
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?

210
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:50,666
Possibly.

211
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,502
"Possibly."

212
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:56,046
If I had a dollar
for every "possibly."

213
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:59,049
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

214
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:04,680
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,

215
00:39:04,763 --> 00:39:07,016
our disappearing man.

216
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:11,896
One Mr. Barry Allen
from Central City.

217
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:13,522
Might be another false positive,

218
00:39:13,647 --> 00:39:14,982
you'll have to give me
a little time

219
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:17,651
- to confirm.
- We don't have any more time.

220
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:20,821
Master Wayne,

221
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:23,407
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

222
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:24,617
to build this team

223
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:26,619
of people you can't even find.

224
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:28,871
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.

225
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:30,998
Just because Lex Luthor says

226
00:39:31,081 --> 00:39:32,958
the planet's
in danger of attack?

227
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:35,252
This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.

228
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:36,712
It has to do with him.

229
00:39:36,795 --> 00:39:40,841
I made a promise to him
on his grave.

230
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:44,053
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

231
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:47,723
I need to bring us together
and make this right.

232
00:39:47,848 --> 00:39:50,559
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

233
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:54,897
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

234
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:58,526
Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.

235
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:00,277
Maybe they're already here.

236
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:06,075
Keep looking.
What else do you have?

237
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:46,573
Lab's all yours, Howard.

238
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:48,450
11:30.

239
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:50,035
Early night for you, Silas.

240
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,621
Yes, early night.

241
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:53,956
Tell your family I said hello.

242
00:41:29,366 --> 00:41:30,993
What the...

243
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:35,831
Jesus.

244
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:51,907
The Arrow of Artemis.

245
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:54,785
It will reach the lands of men.

246
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:05,587
Sky torch,

247
00:43:05,754 --> 00:43:07,423
hero beacon,

248
00:43:07,506 --> 00:43:09,049
scatter the darkness.

249
00:43:09,174 --> 00:43:12,761
Burn as you burned
in days before.

250
00:43:14,096 --> 00:43:17,933
Show her the darkness before
the daylight of history.

251
00:43:18,058 --> 00:43:21,895
Warn my daughter
that war has come

252
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,940
and protect her.

253
00:43:49,548 --> 00:43:51,967
Return to me, Diana.

254
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:31,861
What did you do

255
00:44:31,862 --> 00:44:33,383
this weekend, Diana?

256
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:35,469
Nothing very interesting.

257
00:44:35,594 --> 00:44:38,263
That's all you ever tell us.

258
00:44:38,388 --> 00:44:41,767
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.

259
00:44:41,892 --> 00:44:46,063
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.

260
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:51,568
Again?

261
00:44:51,693 --> 00:44:53,779
- What is it?
- Now what?

262
00:44:53,904 --> 00:44:57,032
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

263
00:44:57,115 --> 00:44:59,868
Now add to the list "arson."

264
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:03,163
Yes, good morning

265
00:45:03,288 --> 00:45:04,748
From the isle of Crete.

266
00:45:04,873 --> 00:45:06,375
As you can see behind me,

267
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,710
an enormous bonfire is burning.

268
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:11,171
This fire has been burning
through the night.

269
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:12,589
We're now into the morning

270
00:45:12,714 --> 00:45:15,092
and we are
at least five miles away.

271
00:45:15,217 --> 00:45:18,512
And we can still
see it burning as we speak.

272
00:45:18,595 --> 00:45:21,890
This has baffled locals and
government authorities alike

273
00:45:22,015 --> 00:45:23,850
here at this historical site

274
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:26,395
of the so-called shrine
of the Amazons.

275
00:45:26,562 --> 00:45:28,355
Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to

276
00:45:28,438 --> 00:45:30,857
- what may have caused this.
- Invasion.

277
00:45:39,783 --> 00:45:40,909
Ryan.

278
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:42,286
- Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...

279
00:45:42,411 --> 00:45:44,413
No damage to the electron-laser.

280
00:45:44,538 --> 00:45:46,790
- Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
- Yeah.

281
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:48,750
- Ryan Choi?
- That's us.

282
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:51,086
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?

283
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:52,713
They took whatever was in here.

284
00:45:52,754 --> 00:45:56,842
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?

285
00:45:56,967 --> 00:45:59,595
No. That was misplaced
a while ago.

286
00:45:59,678 --> 00:46:03,724
Object 6-1-9-8-2. Department
of Defense Archives.

287
00:46:03,765 --> 00:46:05,934
- Mmm-hmm.
- What was it?

288
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:07,019
I don't know.

289
00:46:07,144 --> 00:46:08,437
You don't know?

290
00:46:08,604 --> 00:46:10,606
I don't know, which was why
I was studying it.

291
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:12,357
What's your rank, Doctor?

292
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:14,651
Ryan, would you, uh,
do the honors?

293
00:46:14,776 --> 00:46:16,278
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.

294
00:46:16,403 --> 00:46:18,906
Civilian. STARLABS
is a private contractor.

295
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:20,115
We work for the DoD.

296
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,076
We advise them on xeno-science.

297
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,828
"Xeno-science"?

298
00:46:24,953 --> 00:46:26,955
Alien technology.

299
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:35,923
For example,

300
00:46:36,048 --> 00:46:37,674
the Superman ship.

301
00:46:46,016 --> 00:46:47,309
Eight people

302
00:46:47,392 --> 00:46:49,102
never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.

303
00:46:49,144 --> 00:46:50,354
Cleaning staff, guards,

304
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:52,648
a few of
your research scientists.

305
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:53,690
They were abducted.

306
00:46:54,983 --> 00:46:56,109
Are you sure?

307
00:46:56,234 --> 00:46:58,612
Witness saw it all.
He escaped.

308
00:46:58,695 --> 00:47:02,199
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.

309
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:09,498
Any idea who
or what that might be?

310
00:47:29,434 --> 00:47:31,603
The box isn't safe here.

311
00:47:34,064 --> 00:47:35,524
Victor,

312
00:47:35,607 --> 00:47:37,818
they came looking for it
at the lab.

313
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:42,656
People were taken by some kind
of monster or something.

314
00:47:45,283 --> 00:47:47,369
You know a lot about monsters,

315
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:49,454
don't you?

316
00:47:55,752 --> 00:47:58,547
Especially how to make 'em.

317
00:50:58,393 --> 00:51:02,272
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

318
00:51:03,773 --> 00:51:07,235
My hull is breached.
I'm going down.

319
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:14,326
Mayday!

320
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:16,620
Is there anybody out there?

321
00:51:21,917 --> 00:51:22,959
Ahh!

322
00:51:56,952 --> 00:51:58,119
Whiskey.

323
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:09,881
Tell him to respect
the storm next time.

324
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:20,267
It's on him.

325
00:52:42,497 --> 00:52:46,042
<i>The starry heavens above me</i>

326
00:52:48,753 --> 00:52:52,048
<i>The mortal law within</i>

327
00:52:55,301 --> 00:52:58,388
<i>So the world appears</i>

328
00:53:01,141 --> 00:53:04,686
<i>Through this mist of tears</i>

329
00:53:07,439 --> 00:53:10,400
<i>There is a kingdom</i>

330
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:13,486
<i>There is a king</i>

331
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,239
<i>And he lives without</i>

332
00:53:16,364 --> 00:53:19,367
<i>And he lives within</i>

333
00:53:19,492 --> 00:53:22,537
<i>There is a kingdom</i>

334
00:53:22,662 --> 00:53:25,582
<i>There is a king</i>

335
00:53:25,707 --> 00:53:28,668
<i>There is a king</i>

336
00:53:28,752 --> 00:53:32,047
<i>And he is everything</i>

337
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:50,208
King who would be man.

338
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:53,795
Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.

339
00:54:54,546 --> 00:54:56,131
All the time I've wasted

340
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:59,676
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.

341
00:55:01,636 --> 00:55:02,971
Are you finished, old man?

342
00:55:03,054 --> 00:55:05,473
You never sleep
in the same place twice,

343
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,560
yet you keep coming back here.

344
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:12,355
I like it. It's quiet.

345
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,357
It's your inheritance.

346
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:16,693
You're the rightful king
of Atlantis.

347
00:55:17,694 --> 00:55:18,987
Our people suffer.

348
00:55:19,112 --> 00:55:20,905
Your people.

349
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,659
A brutal, petty,
superstitious race.

350
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:26,953
Is the surface any different?

351
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:29,205
Nobody calls me
King of the Surface.

352
00:55:30,331 --> 00:55:32,459
What do you want, Vulko?

353
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:33,793
Guards near the stronghold

354
00:55:33,835 --> 00:55:35,503
have been disappearing.

355
00:55:35,587 --> 00:55:37,130
Snatchers from above.

356
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:38,464
Talk to King Orm.

357
00:55:38,548 --> 00:55:39,966
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.

358
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:43,428
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.

359
00:55:43,553 --> 00:55:46,139
He lies.

360
00:55:46,222 --> 00:55:48,475
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

361
00:55:48,558 --> 00:55:51,019
They're looking for it.

362
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:55,482
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.

363
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:58,067
Go to the stronghold
of Atlantis.

364
00:55:58,193 --> 00:55:59,694
Protect the box.

365
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,863
The time has come.

366
00:56:03,865 --> 00:56:05,992
Take up your mother's trident.

367
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:20,882
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

368
00:56:21,674 --> 00:56:24,677
Above or below.

369
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,542
DeSaad.

370
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:59,754
DeSaad! I call to thee.

371
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:13,768
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?

372
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:16,938
This world is divided.

373
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:18,606
They are a primitive species.

374
00:57:18,773 --> 00:57:21,234
Unevolved and at war
with one another.

375
00:57:21,317 --> 00:57:24,070
Too separate to be one.

376
00:57:24,112 --> 00:57:26,614
Their free will
must be ripped from them,

377
00:57:26,698 --> 00:57:28,616
like the other worlds.

378
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,996
Given absolution
in one glorious belief,

379
00:57:33,121 --> 00:57:34,872
to serve him.

380
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:37,792
The Mother Boxes?

381
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:40,920
I have found one of the three.

382
00:57:41,004 --> 00:57:43,589
The one that woke
and called to me.

383
00:57:43,673 --> 00:57:45,133
The other two still sleep,

384
00:57:45,258 --> 00:57:49,345
but the parademons
feel their presence.

385
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,930
They fly,

386
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:54,434
they search, they take
prisoners who carry the scent,

387
00:57:54,517 --> 00:57:59,814
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

388
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:02,191
Yes.

389
00:58:03,318 --> 00:58:07,155
Mighty Steppenwolf,

390
00:58:07,238 --> 00:58:11,909
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.

391
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:18,291
But undone by his self-pride.

392
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,960
DeSaad...

393
00:58:21,878 --> 00:58:24,839
I fall before you.

394
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:26,841
Let me make a plea to him

395
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:28,843
that I may come home

396
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:32,055
after I take this world
in his name.

397
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,682
You betrayed him.

398
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,477
Your own family.

399
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,771
I saw my mistake.

400
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:42,357
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

401
00:58:42,482 --> 00:58:47,904
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

402
00:58:48,863 --> 00:58:50,990
He will hear your plea

403
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:53,409
when you pay your debt.

404
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:59,415
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.

405
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:02,502
No protectors here.

406
00:59:02,627 --> 00:59:06,005
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

407
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:10,009
This world will fall,
like all the others.

408
00:59:10,885 --> 00:59:12,845
For Darkseid.

409
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:18,184
For Darkseid.

410
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:41,165
You know,
I paid millions of dollars

411
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:42,917
for this building's security.

412
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:44,752
You got your money's worth.

413
00:59:44,877 --> 00:59:47,338
Took me almost a minute
to disable it.

414
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:50,216
Hi there.

415
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:52,969
A new toy?

416
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:56,013
Prototype troop carrier.

417
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:59,058
I once knew a man

418
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,727
who would have loved to fly it.

419
01:00:01,811 --> 01:00:03,604
The best minds
at Wayne Aerospace

420
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:04,981
couldn't make it fly.

421
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:07,567
But you can?

422
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,277
I have no choice.

423
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,196
I need more range
and I need more cargo.

424
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:14,407
I think
there's an attack coming.

425
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,284
Not coming, Bruce.

426
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:19,620
It's already here.

427
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:21,414
From what I've learned,

428
01:00:21,456 --> 01:00:24,417
they are things
from another universe.

429
01:00:24,459 --> 01:00:26,794
They serve a dark power.

430
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:28,713
An old power.

431
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:30,131
What do they want?

432
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:34,302
To invade.
To conquer.

433
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:38,931
They came here once before,
long ago.

434
01:00:43,895 --> 01:00:46,272
A great armada
appeared in the sky,

435
01:00:46,355 --> 01:00:48,858
laying waste
to all who opposed it.

436
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:53,321
The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.

437
01:00:53,404 --> 01:00:58,409
A name cursed and feared
in every universe.

438
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:02,622
Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.

439
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:05,458
The old gods, men...

440
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:09,003
Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea...

441
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:15,176
Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement

442
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:17,803
and guardians from the stars.

443
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:19,805
- Their histories
- had taught them

444
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:21,599
Not to trust each other,

445
01:01:21,724 --> 01:01:23,810
not to hope for an alliance.

446
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:26,145
To fight apart.

447
01:02:14,777 --> 01:02:17,822
As Darkseid waged war on Earth,

448
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:19,282
he found a secret there.

449
01:02:19,407 --> 01:02:23,202
A power hidden
in the infinity of space.

450
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:24,787
He called forth mystics

451
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:28,207
who worshipped and controlled
three objects...

452
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,709
the Mother Boxes.

453
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:31,377
Wait, wait, wait.

454
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,253
"Mother Boxes"?

455
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,506
Indestructible living machines,

456
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:38,467
made from a science so advanced,

457
01:02:38,593 --> 01:02:40,595
it looks like sorcery.

458
01:02:40,678 --> 01:02:42,055
To conquer, three boxes

459
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:43,431
have to synchronize

460
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:46,726
and join together
into The Unity.

461
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:49,937
The Unity cleanses
a planet with fire,

462
01:02:50,021 --> 01:02:53,733
transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.

463
01:02:53,816 --> 01:02:57,653
All who live
become servants of Darkseid.

464
01:02:57,778 --> 01:03:00,740
Alive but drained of life.

465
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:02,325
Parademons.

466
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,536
Amazons!

467
01:03:11,459 --> 01:03:13,002
With me!

468
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:44,950
But before The Unity
could synchronize,

469
01:03:45,034 --> 01:03:46,994
the defenders of Earth attacked

470
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:48,871
and fought as one.

471
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:52,041
Amazons alongside Atlanteans.

472
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:53,668
Zeus and his son Ares

473
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:57,463
alongside the guardians
from the sky.

474
01:03:57,546 --> 01:04:00,800
A golden Age of Heroes
fighting together

475
01:04:00,925 --> 01:04:02,468
to defend life on Earth.

476
01:05:58,834 --> 01:06:01,670
They did what no world
had ever done.

477
01:06:01,796 --> 01:06:04,131
Sent the enemies
back into the stars.

478
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:10,304
The three Mother Boxes
never synchronized.

479
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:12,140
-The Unity never came to pass.

480
01:06:13,933 --> 01:06:16,477
But, in their retreat,

481
01:06:16,602 --> 01:06:19,688
the boxes were left behind
on Earth.

482
01:06:19,814 --> 01:06:23,776
They grew weak.
Dogs without masters

483
01:06:25,653 --> 01:06:27,154
falling asleep,

484
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:29,657
awaiting their return.

485
01:06:29,782 --> 01:06:32,284
Fading from the view
of the enemy,

486
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:35,663
anonymous
among a trillion worlds.

487
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:55,975
The defenders of Earth
made a vow.

488
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:59,311
Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.

489
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:01,230
Each would enshrine and guard

490
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:03,149
one of the three
sleeping Mother Boxes

491
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:07,027
according to the rites
and rituals of their culture

492
01:07:07,194 --> 01:07:09,697
in case a box
should ever wake again

493
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:11,740
to call out
to the planet Apokolips

494
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:13,534
to return and conquer

495
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:17,621
the only world
Darkseid had ever lost.

496
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:36,575
Something woke the box
my people guard.

497
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,744
It called out
to the dark place...

498
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:41,580
to one of Darkseid's conquerors.

499
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,583
The enemy is here.

500
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,418
If he's here, where is he?

501
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:48,629
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.

502
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:51,757
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.

503
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,220
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.

504
01:08:56,345 --> 01:08:59,431
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.

505
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:01,100
No, it will.

506
01:09:01,183 --> 01:09:02,935
It has to.

507
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:08,315
The others.
Where are they?

508
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:31,171
Am I late?

509
01:09:31,338 --> 01:09:33,841
No, I'm so late.
I'm very late.

510
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:35,426
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

511
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:37,302
Oh. No.

512
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:40,347
Okay, bye. Okay.

513
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:42,850
I'm so sorry.

514
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:44,310
I'm late.

515
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:50,983
- Are you, uh...
- I'm...

516
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:52,943
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.

517
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:54,653
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.

518
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:56,030
Essentially,
the bus didn't come,

519
01:09:56,196 --> 01:09:57,323
then the bus did come,

520
01:09:57,406 --> 01:09:58,365
but then there was
this old woman

521
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,658
counting change for the fare,

522
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:01,076
like, nickel, penny,
nickel, penny.

523
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:02,870
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.

524
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:04,121
She's 107 years old,

525
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:05,831
these are some of her
last few moments of life.

526
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:07,249
Resume.

527
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:08,375
Resume.

528
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:13,547
Come on.

529
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:17,176
Come on.

530
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:18,844
From the French, of course.

531
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:22,056
"Resume," I believe,
is a past participle of...

532
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:29,146
Uh, wow. That's no good.

533
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:30,898
It's like, what lives
in my pocket, right?

534
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:33,859
"Paper monster hungry."
Uh...

535
01:10:41,867 --> 01:10:44,745
Come on. Supposed to be
friends now.

536
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:52,419
Yes.

537
01:11:01,095 --> 01:11:03,597
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.

538
01:11:03,764 --> 01:11:04,973
You said you had experience

539
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:06,100
walking dogs.

540
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:58,110
<i>Long afloat</i>

541
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:02,698
<i>On shipless oceans</i>

542
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:12,166
<i>I did all my best to smile</i>

543
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:18,881
<i>'Til your singing eyes
and fingers</i>

544
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:25,929
<i>Drew me loving to your isle</i>

545
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:34,771
<i>Did I dream
you dreamed about me?</i>

546
01:12:34,897 --> 01:12:42,070
<i>Were you here
when I was forced out?</i>

547
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:48,827
<i>Now my foolish boat
is leaning</i>

548
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:56,043
<i>Broken lovelorn
on your rocks</i>

549
01:12:57,836 --> 01:13:04,051
<i>Here I am
Here I am</i>

550
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:13,060
<i>Waiting to hold you</i>

551
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:48,595
Oh, gosh,
I hope everyone's okay.

552
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,390
See, in times of crisis,
for dog work,

553
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:53,475
I always bring a meat snack.

554
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,310
'Cause it makes them feel calm.

555
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:57,229
'Cause you never know what's going
to happen in this city.

556
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:58,772
I mean, oh, my gosh.

557
01:13:58,897 --> 01:14:01,692
Right? I start on Monday?

558
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:42,649
You have been near a Mother Box.

559
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:46,278
The scent is on you.

560
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,779
Where is it?

561
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:51,491
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.

562
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:07,966
Our people have guarded
the Mother Box

563
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:09,343
for thousands of years.

564
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:18,185
I will never betray
my own people.

565
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:32,199
You already have.

566
01:16:32,342 --> 01:16:33,802
This was taken in

567
01:16:33,803 --> 01:16:35,262
the deepest trench on Earth.

568
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,472
He must be an Atlantean.

569
01:16:37,597 --> 01:16:38,974
A water-breather.

570
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:40,600
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.

571
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:42,561
Mixed-blood, then.

572
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:44,563
He said he'll fight with us?

573
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:46,106
More or less.

574
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:49,776
More more or more less?

575
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:50,902
Probably more less.

576
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:53,071
- He said no?
- He said no.

577
01:16:53,155 --> 01:16:55,782
Atlanteans can be tricky.

578
01:16:55,907 --> 01:16:58,827
My people went to war
with them once.

579
01:16:59,828 --> 01:17:01,788
I'm not sure we can trust him.

580
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:03,039
Diana, if we're gonna do this,

581
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:04,166
you're gonna need to be open

582
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,625
to more things that we didn't...

583
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:06,960
you know...

584
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:08,336
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.

585
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:09,754
Don't worry about it.

586
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:11,047
- Let's...
- It happens.

587
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:12,591
So...

588
01:17:12,632 --> 01:17:14,301
This is the third person.

589
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:16,970
Disappears for 1/30
of a second here.

590
01:17:17,053 --> 01:17:18,680
One frame of video, see?

591
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:21,475
Barry Allen. Central City.

592
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:22,517
Go to him.

593
01:17:22,642 --> 01:17:24,186
I'll work on number four.

594
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:27,606
Organic and biomechatronic
body parts.

595
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:32,235
He's a cyborg.

596
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:53,340
- Ready!
- Break!

597
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,190
Three...

598
01:18:10,273 --> 01:18:11,858
eighty...

599
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:15,028
set... go!

600
01:18:27,874 --> 01:18:30,252
Your son may be captain
of the football team

601
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:33,630
and a certified genius,
Mrs. Stone...

602
01:18:33,755 --> 01:18:35,924
Dr. Stone.

603
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:40,220
...but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system

604
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:43,098
to change his friend's grades.

605
01:18:43,223 --> 01:18:47,060
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.

606
01:18:47,143 --> 01:18:49,855
How could that child
pass her classes?

607
01:18:51,147 --> 01:18:54,234
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.

608
01:18:54,317 --> 01:18:56,486
What did you do to help her?

609
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:23,573
- Your father...
- Mom, Mom, don't.

610
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:27,869
He got held up at the lab.

611
01:20:27,994 --> 01:20:31,206
Okay. He always does.

612
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:35,001
He wanted to be here.

613
01:20:35,168 --> 01:20:37,128
You always say that.

614
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:38,797
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.

615
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:41,675
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.

616
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:45,720
He just has difficulty
showing it, but...

617
01:20:45,845 --> 01:20:48,014
I know he's proud of you.

618
01:20:48,139 --> 01:20:50,725
We both are, Victor.

619
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:54,020
Hey, hey, hey.

620
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:57,190
With everything I know
you can do today,

621
01:20:57,315 --> 01:21:00,068
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

622
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:07,283
- Dr. Stone,
- I'm sorry,

623
01:21:08,201 --> 01:21:10,203
Your wife didn't survive.

624
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:14,040
I'm afraid
your son won't either.

625
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:29,681
I won't let you die.

626
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:34,310
I won't allow it.

627
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:42,360
I won't allow it.

628
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,740
Victor.

629
01:21:48,074 --> 01:21:51,411
Victor, you're not
stuck in here.

630
01:21:51,536 --> 01:21:54,706
You still have a life
ahead of you.

631
01:21:54,831 --> 01:21:58,543
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

632
01:22:00,962 --> 01:22:02,589
If you were there,

633
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:05,800
Mom would still be alive.

634
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,597
All right, look,

635
01:22:11,765 --> 01:22:14,267
you don't have to give me
a second chance,

636
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:16,144
but give yourself one.

637
01:22:17,979 --> 01:22:21,232
If you can't stand
looking at me,

638
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:24,486
try listening.

639
01:22:54,267 --> 01:22:55,642
What you can do now, Victor.

640
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:59,479
Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.

641
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:02,357
The tip of the tip.

642
01:23:32,053 --> 01:23:34,347
In the world of ones and zeroes,

643
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:37,141
you are the absolute master.

644
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:40,019
No firewall can stop you.

645
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:42,355
No encryption can defy you.

646
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,066
We're all at your mercy, Vic.

647
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:47,735
From our power grids
to our telecommunications,

648
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:49,904
everyone's lives are controlled

649
01:23:50,029 --> 01:23:51,531
and dominated

650
01:23:51,532 --> 01:23:53,032
by complex digital networks

651
01:23:53,116 --> 01:23:57,537
that will bend
without effort to your will.

652
01:24:07,672 --> 01:24:09,340
The fate of the world

653
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:12,427
will literally
rest in your hands.

654
01:24:20,101 --> 01:24:22,228
Its entire nuclear arsenal,

655
01:24:22,312 --> 01:24:25,315
you could launch with a thought.

656
01:24:35,783 --> 01:24:37,368
The world's monetary systems

657
01:24:37,452 --> 01:24:38,953
and its complex interactions

658
01:24:39,078 --> 01:24:42,040
will seem as easy
to manipulate for you

659
01:24:42,123 --> 01:24:43,791
as a child's plaything.

660
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:21,621
The question...
No, the challenge

661
01:25:22,372 --> 01:25:25,500
won't be doing it.

662
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:27,752
It will be not doing.

663
01:25:27,835 --> 01:25:29,837
Not seeing.

664
01:25:31,714 --> 01:25:33,967
It is the burden
of this responsibility

665
01:25:34,092 --> 01:25:37,679
that will define you
and who you choose to be.

666
01:26:09,168 --> 01:26:10,253
Now, make a wish.

667
01:26:11,504 --> 01:26:13,381
One more time.

668
01:26:13,506 --> 01:26:16,009
Good job. Wave to Grandma!

669
01:26:16,134 --> 01:26:17,427
Hi, Grandma!

670
01:27:17,403 --> 01:27:18,696
What?

671
01:27:20,615 --> 01:27:22,450
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

672
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:25,036
Oh, my God.

673
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:26,871
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

674
01:27:32,168 --> 01:27:34,879
Victor...

675
01:27:34,962 --> 01:27:39,550
Victor, these are the words
and deductions of a scientist.

676
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:41,928
That's how I've been
speaking to you.

677
01:27:42,553 --> 01:27:45,556
Now,

678
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:50,103
let me speak to you
from my heart, not as a scientist,

679
01:27:50,228 --> 01:27:51,562
as a father.

680
01:28:05,868 --> 01:28:06,953
Hey.

681
01:28:08,162 --> 01:28:09,747
Hey, you!

682
01:28:25,388 --> 01:28:27,140
Because you are

683
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:28,891
holding yourself back.

684
01:28:29,016 --> 01:28:32,061
You're going in circles, man.

685
01:28:32,186 --> 01:28:34,522
Holding down
three dead-end jobs,

686
01:28:34,647 --> 01:28:35,773
going on four.

687
01:28:35,857 --> 01:28:37,316
Where do you even find the time?

688
01:28:37,483 --> 01:28:38,651
I make the time.

689
01:28:38,776 --> 01:28:40,069
- I just need one more gig...
- Barry.

690
01:28:40,194 --> 01:28:41,154
...then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.

691
01:28:41,237 --> 01:28:42,280
You can't.

692
01:28:42,405 --> 01:28:43,698
Like I always said I would.

693
01:28:43,823 --> 01:28:45,158
You cannot keep
doing this to yourself.

694
01:28:45,324 --> 01:28:46,951
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

695
01:28:47,034 --> 01:28:48,453
- Please, we have 10 minutes.
- And this is all to pay

696
01:28:48,536 --> 01:28:49,745
for a criminal justice degree,
huh?

697
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:50,872
Yeah.

698
01:28:50,997 --> 01:28:52,039
For what?

699
01:28:52,165 --> 01:28:55,084
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,

700
01:28:55,209 --> 01:28:56,836
who's still in prison
for the murder

701
01:28:56,919 --> 01:28:58,337
of my mother,
which he didn't commit.

702
01:28:58,463 --> 01:29:00,381
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

703
01:29:00,506 --> 01:29:02,133
I can't remember.

704
01:29:02,216 --> 01:29:03,509
Oh, boy.

705
01:29:03,593 --> 01:29:05,928
This path has clearly
chosen me, Dad.

706
01:29:06,762 --> 01:29:08,014
Give me your hand, man.

707
01:29:13,352 --> 01:29:16,689
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.

708
01:29:16,856 --> 01:29:20,610
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

709
01:29:26,365 --> 01:29:28,493
I want you to give all that up.

710
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,498
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

711
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:39,837
I am a drag on your life.

712
01:29:45,218 --> 01:29:46,886
Okay. Um...

713
01:29:47,053 --> 01:29:50,515
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

714
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,849
Please.

715
01:29:51,974 --> 01:29:53,517
Hey, you know what
criminal justice

716
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:55,353
would be for me?

717
01:29:55,436 --> 01:30:00,233
My son not wasting his life.

718
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:03,402
You can be
whatever you wanna be.

719
01:30:03,486 --> 01:30:04,904
You're brilliant, man.

720
01:30:07,406 --> 01:30:10,201
Absolute best of the best.

721
01:30:11,702 --> 01:30:16,707
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

722
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:18,626
for some old dude

723
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:21,921
who's not going anywhere.

724
01:30:22,004 --> 01:30:23,464
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

725
01:30:23,589 --> 01:30:24,799
That's not true.

726
01:30:24,924 --> 01:30:26,384
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

727
01:30:26,467 --> 01:30:28,052
I want you
to make your own future.

728
01:30:28,094 --> 01:30:30,096
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

729
01:30:30,221 --> 01:30:31,556
Open gate.

730
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:33,140
Great.

731
01:30:36,644 --> 01:30:38,938
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

732
01:30:39,105 --> 01:30:40,648
Clear.
Close the gate.

733
01:31:33,492 --> 01:31:36,787
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

734
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:38,372
You said that like it explains

735
01:31:38,497 --> 01:31:40,833
why there's a total stranger
in my place

736
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,086
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

737
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,882
Tell me about this.

738
01:31:51,844 --> 01:31:54,638
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

739
01:31:54,722 --> 01:31:57,683
but who is definitely not me.

740
01:31:58,601 --> 01:32:00,478
Somebody... I don't know.

741
01:32:00,603 --> 01:32:02,480
Hippie, long hair.

742
01:32:02,605 --> 01:32:05,399
Very attractive Jewish boy.

743
01:32:06,901 --> 01:32:09,570
Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.

744
01:32:09,695 --> 01:32:11,155
I know you have abilities.

745
01:32:11,197 --> 01:32:13,491
I just don't know what they are.

746
01:32:13,616 --> 01:32:14,659
My special skills

747
01:32:14,742 --> 01:32:17,411
include viola, web design,

748
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:20,373
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

749
01:32:20,498 --> 01:32:24,210
Silica-based sand quartz fabric.

750
01:32:24,293 --> 01:32:26,545
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.

751
01:32:26,712 --> 01:32:28,589
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

752
01:32:28,714 --> 01:32:30,341
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

753
01:32:30,466 --> 01:32:32,176
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

754
01:32:32,301 --> 01:32:35,054
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

755
01:32:36,263 --> 01:32:38,182
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

756
01:32:38,265 --> 01:32:40,559
but whoever you're looking for,

757
01:32:40,643 --> 01:32:41,811
it's not me.

758
01:33:23,477 --> 01:33:25,396
You're the Batman?

759
01:33:25,479 --> 01:33:28,274
So, you're fast.

760
01:33:28,357 --> 01:33:30,025
That feels
like an oversimplification.

761
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:31,944
I'm putting together a team.

762
01:33:32,069 --> 01:33:34,113
People with special abilities.

763
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,906
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

764
01:33:35,948 --> 01:33:38,200
Stop right there. I'm in.

765
01:33:39,285 --> 01:33:40,578
You are?

766
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:41,745
Just like that?

767
01:33:41,829 --> 01:33:43,122
Yeah.

768
01:33:44,915 --> 01:33:47,460
I need friends.

769
01:33:47,585 --> 01:33:50,838
Great. Great.

770
01:33:50,963 --> 01:33:53,174
Can I keep this?

771
01:33:53,299 --> 01:33:55,134
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

772
01:33:55,217 --> 01:33:56,927
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

773
01:33:57,052 --> 01:33:58,471
I call it the Speed Force.

774
01:33:58,596 --> 01:34:00,306
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

775
01:34:00,389 --> 01:34:03,267
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

776
01:34:03,392 --> 01:34:05,853
I am a snack hole.

777
01:34:05,978 --> 01:34:08,856
How many people are
on this special fight team?

778
01:34:08,981 --> 01:34:10,941
- Three, including you.
- Three?

779
01:34:11,025 --> 01:34:13,778
Against what?

780
01:34:13,861 --> 01:34:15,404
I'll tell you on the plane.

781
01:34:15,946 --> 01:34:17,740
Plane?

782
01:34:17,865 --> 01:34:19,617
What are your superpowers again?

783
01:34:19,742 --> 01:34:21,494
I'm rich.

784
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:46,310
Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that.

785
01:34:46,393 --> 01:34:49,355
No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

786
01:34:49,522 --> 01:34:51,315
Would you like to have some?

787
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,858
Uh, no, thank you.

788
01:34:54,026 --> 01:34:56,487
If you put the water in first.

789
01:34:56,529 --> 01:34:59,949
- Of course.
- So we don't scald the tea.

790
01:35:02,743 --> 01:35:04,161
- Yes.
- Great.

791
01:35:04,245 --> 01:35:06,497
No, that's probably enough tea.

792
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:08,874
All right.

793
01:35:08,999 --> 01:35:10,376
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

794
01:35:10,543 --> 01:35:14,588
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

795
01:35:14,713 --> 01:35:17,716
I will.
I will, definitely will.

796
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,010
Uh... What are you working on?

797
01:35:20,094 --> 01:35:21,929
It's a gauntlet

798
01:35:22,054 --> 01:35:25,850
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

799
01:35:25,933 --> 01:35:28,352
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.

800
01:35:28,394 --> 01:35:31,605
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.

801
01:35:33,107 --> 01:35:34,525
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

802
01:35:34,608 --> 01:35:36,235
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.

803
01:35:36,318 --> 01:35:37,361
Of course.

804
01:35:42,533 --> 01:35:44,118
Ah.

805
01:35:44,243 --> 01:35:47,246
Ah, now, let's see how that did.

806
01:35:47,329 --> 01:35:49,748
Ha! Yes.

807
01:35:49,873 --> 01:35:51,417
Not to be sneezed at.

808
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:54,044
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

809
01:35:54,128 --> 01:35:55,921
It's Master Wayne's idea.

810
01:35:56,005 --> 01:35:58,257
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

811
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:01,218
- In black, of course.
- Oh.

812
01:36:07,975 --> 01:36:11,145
All right. Victor Stone.

813
01:36:27,202 --> 01:36:29,663
Something is not working.

814
01:36:29,788 --> 01:36:31,457
Mmm.

815
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:43,510
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.

816
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:43,737
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

817
01:37:43,862 --> 01:37:45,155
You know who I am.

818
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:47,491
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

819
01:37:47,574 --> 01:37:50,828
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

820
01:37:50,953 --> 01:37:52,162
The world does.

821
01:37:53,247 --> 01:37:55,207
Fuck the world.

822
01:37:56,583 --> 01:37:59,211
You've obviously
been through a great deal.

823
01:38:00,254 --> 01:38:03,340
I can't begin to imagine what.

824
01:38:03,382 --> 01:38:07,011
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

825
01:38:07,094 --> 01:38:08,929
Gifts?

826
01:38:09,054 --> 01:38:11,223
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

827
01:38:11,306 --> 01:38:13,058
We need you, Victor.

828
01:38:13,183 --> 01:38:14,893
And maybe you need us.

829
01:38:14,977 --> 01:38:16,687
I don't need anyone.

830
01:38:18,897 --> 01:38:20,065
Not anymore.

831
01:38:20,149 --> 01:38:22,609
I told myself the same
for a long time.

832
01:38:29,283 --> 01:38:32,244
I lost someone I loved once.

833
01:38:34,997 --> 01:38:39,752
I shut myself off from everyone.

834
01:38:41,336 --> 01:38:44,256
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

835
01:38:46,675 --> 01:38:50,262
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

836
01:38:50,345 --> 01:38:54,308
And if you asked to meet me...

837
01:38:54,433 --> 01:38:57,352
you're working on it, too.

838
01:40:08,757 --> 01:40:10,968
You were right
about the metal sample

839
01:40:11,009 --> 01:40:12,553
from the Superman ship.

840
01:40:12,678 --> 01:40:16,140
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

841
01:40:16,265 --> 01:40:17,850
look what happens.

842
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:28,652
3.5 million kelvin.

843
01:40:28,694 --> 01:40:31,947
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

844
01:40:32,072 --> 01:40:34,491
Hot, dense matter.

845
01:40:37,578 --> 01:40:40,414
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

846
01:40:40,539 --> 01:40:42,875
Exact words I said
to my prom date.

847
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:44,585
She dumped me anyway.

848
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:45,836
Yeah.

849
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,174
Hey, Doc,

850
01:40:51,258 --> 01:40:52,843
do you think Batman is connected

851
01:40:52,885 --> 01:40:55,679
to the object
the CID is looking for?

852
01:40:56,597 --> 01:40:59,850
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

853
01:41:01,018 --> 01:41:02,227
No...

854
01:41:03,061 --> 01:41:04,396
I don't.

855
01:41:39,139 --> 01:41:41,350
Oh, Victor.

856
01:41:58,325 --> 01:42:00,410
All right! Let's go!

857
01:42:01,495 --> 01:42:02,829
Commissioner Gordon?

858
01:42:02,955 --> 01:42:03,997
Come on!

859
01:42:04,122 --> 01:42:05,290
Your messages.

860
01:42:05,415 --> 01:42:06,875
Hey, hey!

861
01:42:09,628 --> 01:42:12,130
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

862
01:42:12,256 --> 01:42:15,342
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged
community showed up.

863
01:42:15,467 --> 01:42:17,636
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

864
01:42:17,719 --> 01:42:19,721
You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.

865
01:42:19,846 --> 01:42:21,682
What's wrong with dental school?

866
01:42:24,601 --> 01:42:27,688
"Attacked by
a flying vampire."

867
01:42:27,813 --> 01:42:31,024
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

868
01:42:31,149 --> 01:42:32,818
On a possibly related note,

869
01:42:32,901 --> 01:42:35,320
sketch of the suspect
in the abductions

870
01:42:35,445 --> 01:42:36,947
at the lab across the harbor.

871
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:40,158
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.

872
01:42:40,325 --> 01:42:42,911
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

873
01:42:43,036 --> 01:42:45,914
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

874
01:42:46,999 --> 01:42:48,083
I'll talk to him tonight.

875
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:49,793
How, Jim?

876
01:42:49,918 --> 01:42:51,503
How do you think?

877
01:43:09,563 --> 01:43:10,981
Silas?

878
01:43:11,106 --> 01:43:12,315
Hey, hey.

879
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:13,859
Hey, hey!

880
01:43:18,321 --> 01:43:20,866
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?

881
01:43:20,991 --> 01:43:22,034
His name is Victor.

882
01:43:22,951 --> 01:43:25,704
We met, spoke.

883
01:43:26,538 --> 01:43:28,540
Give him time.

884
01:43:28,707 --> 01:43:30,709
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

885
01:43:30,792 --> 01:43:34,588
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

886
01:43:34,713 --> 01:43:37,049
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.

887
01:43:37,174 --> 01:43:38,508
Oh!

888
01:43:38,592 --> 01:43:41,386
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

889
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:43,555
- Oh, sorry.
- That's your signal.

890
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:45,140
That means we have to go now.

891
01:43:45,265 --> 01:43:48,977
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool.

892
01:44:46,118 --> 01:44:47,869
Commander Mera, I told the king

893
01:44:47,994 --> 01:44:49,746
the perimeter guards were taken.

894
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:51,373
He won't send reinforcements.

895
01:44:51,498 --> 01:44:54,084
He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

896
01:44:54,209 --> 01:44:58,672
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.

897
01:44:58,797 --> 01:45:00,465
All right, take what men
we have left

898
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:02,300
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.

899
01:46:42,234 --> 01:46:44,236
You can't escape.

900
01:46:45,111 --> 01:46:47,072
I'm not trying to.

901
01:48:49,402 --> 01:48:51,738
Vulko told me you would come.

902
01:48:51,863 --> 01:48:54,783
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

903
01:48:57,369 --> 01:48:58,703
Wait.

904
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:01,790
Please.

905
01:49:05,335 --> 01:49:06,753
I knew her.

906
01:49:08,797 --> 01:49:11,091
Well, that makes one of us.

907
01:49:11,216 --> 01:49:13,051
My parents died in the wars.

908
01:49:14,761 --> 01:49:16,346
She took me in.

909
01:49:16,429 --> 01:49:18,098
What a saint.

910
01:49:18,223 --> 01:49:20,350
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

911
01:49:20,433 --> 01:49:23,186
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

912
01:49:23,269 --> 01:49:25,021
and never gave me
another thought.

913
01:49:25,063 --> 01:49:28,274
Your mother left you
to save your life.

914
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:31,111
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

915
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:34,781
What it cost her.

916
01:49:35,824 --> 01:49:38,159
But you're not
a defenseless child now.

917
01:49:40,328 --> 01:49:42,038
It would have been
her responsibility

918
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:45,417
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

919
01:49:46,084 --> 01:49:47,168
Now,

920
01:49:48,461 --> 01:49:49,879
it's yours.

921
01:50:54,152 --> 01:50:55,487
Yes.

922
01:51:18,551 --> 01:51:19,802
Steppenwolf,

923
01:51:19,928 --> 01:51:21,888
tell me what you've learned.

924
01:51:22,013 --> 01:51:24,516
Two boxes found and awake.

925
01:51:24,682 --> 01:51:27,685
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

926
01:51:27,769 --> 01:51:31,022
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

927
01:51:31,105 --> 01:51:33,650
Where is the third Mother Box?

928
01:51:33,733 --> 01:51:36,152
The parademons
sense its presence

929
01:51:36,194 --> 01:51:37,904
and search for the third.

930
01:51:38,029 --> 01:51:39,030
They have taken prisoners

931
01:51:39,155 --> 01:51:41,366
who carry its scent.

932
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,827
Go.

933
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:46,037
Interrogate the prisoners.

934
01:51:46,704 --> 01:51:48,540
Find the third.

935
01:51:50,041 --> 01:51:52,335
They will tell me
what they know,

936
01:51:53,378 --> 01:51:56,130
or I will rip it from them.

937
01:52:39,257 --> 01:52:41,050
How many of you are there?

938
01:52:41,801 --> 01:52:43,052
Not enough.

939
01:52:44,762 --> 01:52:47,181
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

940
01:52:47,307 --> 01:52:48,683
Description matches the suspect

941
01:52:48,808 --> 01:52:50,602
in the Metropolis abductions.

942
01:52:50,727 --> 01:52:51,895
Parademons.

943
01:52:52,437 --> 01:52:53,771
Okay.

944
01:52:53,938 --> 01:52:56,149
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

945
01:52:56,274 --> 01:52:57,650
At the lab.

946
01:52:57,775 --> 01:52:59,903
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

947
01:52:59,986 --> 01:53:01,070
So the eight may still be alive.

948
01:53:01,112 --> 01:53:02,113
Nine.

949
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:04,115
Oh.

950
01:53:04,198 --> 01:53:06,951
The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.

951
01:53:11,956 --> 01:53:14,626
Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

952
01:53:14,751 --> 01:53:16,002
So, how do we find him?

953
01:53:16,127 --> 01:53:17,670
There must be a nest nearby.

954
01:53:17,795 --> 01:53:22,091
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

955
01:53:22,175 --> 01:53:24,302
No discernable pattern
I can see.

956
01:53:24,427 --> 01:53:25,887
The lines on the map
don't converge.

957
01:53:26,012 --> 01:53:27,305
On land.

958
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:28,848
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

959
01:53:28,973 --> 01:53:30,099
between the two cities.

960
01:53:30,183 --> 01:53:31,267
These are air vents.

961
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:32,852
They all lead down to the tunnel

962
01:53:32,977 --> 01:53:35,146
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

963
01:53:35,313 --> 01:53:37,482
The nest could be there.

964
01:53:37,607 --> 01:53:39,567
Uh, is he coming with us now,

965
01:53:39,692 --> 01:53:41,653
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

966
01:53:41,778 --> 01:53:43,237
I have something bigger.

967
01:53:44,364 --> 01:53:47,241
Do you really think that...

968
01:53:47,367 --> 01:53:50,954
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

969
01:53:50,995 --> 01:53:53,581
Oh. That's rude.

970
01:54:32,203 --> 01:54:34,247
We're close.

971
01:54:34,372 --> 01:54:36,541
The scent of the enemy.

972
01:54:37,166 --> 01:54:38,418
Of absence.

973
01:54:38,918 --> 01:54:40,545
Darkness.

974
01:54:41,170 --> 01:54:42,547
Death.

975
01:54:42,714 --> 01:54:43,756
Where are we, Alfred?

976
01:54:43,881 --> 01:54:45,049
Stryker's Island.

977
01:54:45,133 --> 01:54:47,176
You should be directly under

978
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:50,054
the venting tower
for the tunnel.

979
01:54:50,138 --> 01:54:51,514
Now look to your left,

980
01:54:51,597 --> 01:54:53,558
you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.

981
01:54:53,641 --> 01:54:56,227
Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.

982
01:54:56,352 --> 01:54:57,687
That's it.

983
01:54:57,812 --> 01:54:59,188
Let's go.

984
01:55:12,994 --> 01:55:15,747
Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?

985
01:55:17,248 --> 01:55:18,499
Either of you?

986
01:55:18,624 --> 01:55:20,668
Don't engage alone.

987
01:55:20,793 --> 01:55:22,086
We do this together.

988
01:55:30,970 --> 01:55:32,764
I heard about you.

989
01:55:34,474 --> 01:55:36,058
Didn't think you were real.

990
01:55:36,142 --> 01:55:37,727
I'm real when it's useful.

991
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:49,572
I grow tired of your silence.

992
01:55:49,697 --> 01:55:52,074
Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?

993
01:55:58,956 --> 01:56:01,125
Please. We have families.

994
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:03,503
Then you have weakness.

995
01:56:03,628 --> 01:56:05,004
Steppenwolf.

996
01:56:05,129 --> 01:56:09,467
Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.

997
01:56:09,634 --> 01:56:10,802
Good guess.

998
01:56:10,927 --> 01:56:14,680
I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.

999
01:56:14,806 --> 01:56:16,766
Circle to the other side.

1000
01:56:16,849 --> 01:56:19,227
We'll surround them
and surprise him.

1001
01:56:23,523 --> 01:56:25,650
You have been near a Mother Box.

1002
01:56:25,733 --> 01:56:27,318
The scent is on you.

1003
01:56:27,443 --> 01:56:28,986
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1004
01:56:29,153 --> 01:56:30,988
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

1005
01:56:31,155 --> 01:56:33,491
He... He doesn't know.

1006
01:56:37,036 --> 01:56:38,830
Wait, please, please!

1007
01:56:44,252 --> 01:56:47,296
You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.

1008
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:49,674
I will die before I tell you.

1009
01:56:49,841 --> 01:56:51,884
You'll die if you don't.

1010
01:56:52,009 --> 01:56:53,177
No!

1011
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:03,354
Victor.

1012
01:57:03,479 --> 01:57:04,856
Kill them both.

1013
01:57:08,359 --> 01:57:10,820
Ah, Amazon.

1014
01:57:10,903 --> 01:57:13,573
But not like your sisters.

1015
01:57:13,698 --> 01:57:14,824
Stronger.

1016
01:57:45,855 --> 01:57:48,190
Amazon.

1017
01:57:50,568 --> 01:57:52,069
Hold!

1018
01:57:52,195 --> 01:57:54,488
This one will be mine.

1019
01:57:56,324 --> 01:57:58,826
I belong to no one.

1020
01:58:12,632 --> 01:58:14,842
Guys, this is not together.

1021
01:58:21,682 --> 01:58:23,100
Help get those people
out of here.

1022
01:58:23,226 --> 01:58:25,394
I'll make sure these things
follow me.

1023
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:36,781
Everybody, move!

1024
01:58:45,414 --> 01:58:46,958
A little quicker.

1025
01:58:49,293 --> 01:58:50,586
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1026
01:58:50,711 --> 01:58:53,464
I've got this. Keep moving.

1027
01:58:55,299 --> 01:58:56,258
This way.

1028
01:59:32,586 --> 01:59:34,171
The energy is dissipating.

1029
01:59:34,255 --> 01:59:36,757
My gauntlet worked!

1030
01:59:36,882 --> 01:59:39,343
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.

1031
01:59:39,427 --> 01:59:41,512
Thought you'd never ask.

1032
01:59:41,595 --> 01:59:43,848
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

1033
02:00:14,045 --> 02:00:15,004
Thank you, Alfred.

1034
02:00:15,129 --> 02:00:16,380
Don't mention it.

1035
02:00:39,236 --> 02:00:40,404
No!

1036
02:00:43,949 --> 02:00:44,950
Whew.

1037
02:00:48,079 --> 02:00:49,663
They're safe.
Get back to the tunnel.

1038
02:00:49,789 --> 02:00:53,125
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

1039
02:01:04,887 --> 02:01:06,097
My turn.

1040
02:02:28,262 --> 02:02:29,930
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.

1041
02:02:30,055 --> 02:02:32,600
Are you all right, Master Wayne?

1042
02:02:32,725 --> 02:02:33,851
Are you all right?

1043
02:02:44,236 --> 02:02:48,032
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.

1044
02:03:02,296 --> 02:03:03,506
You okay?

1045
02:03:04,006 --> 02:03:05,216
Mm.

1046
02:03:05,341 --> 02:03:07,009
Wasn't sure you'd come.

1047
02:03:08,052 --> 02:03:09,261
You're my father.

1048
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:13,891
Go.

1049
02:03:27,404 --> 02:03:28,572
No!

1050
02:04:13,826 --> 02:04:16,287
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.

1051
02:04:17,788 --> 02:04:19,790
Uh, do I know you?

1052
02:04:50,571 --> 02:04:51,905
What are we under, right now?

1053
02:04:52,573 --> 02:04:53,949
Gotham Harbor.

1054
02:05:32,571 --> 02:05:33,947
Who is that?

1055
02:05:59,223 --> 02:06:00,391
Come on.

1056
02:06:05,521 --> 02:06:06,814
Diana, get on!

1057
02:07:08,625 --> 02:07:10,169
What is it?

1058
02:07:17,801 --> 02:07:19,344
Show me.

1059
02:07:58,550 --> 02:08:00,177
It is here.

1060
02:08:00,844 --> 02:08:03,972
On this world.

1061
02:08:37,714 --> 02:08:39,007
Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine

1062
02:08:39,132 --> 02:08:40,509
for possible alien microbes.

1063
02:08:40,592 --> 02:08:42,386
U.S. government protocols
require that...

1064
02:08:42,511 --> 02:08:45,514
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

1065
02:08:49,977 --> 02:08:51,478
It called to him.

1066
02:08:51,603 --> 02:08:53,021
The Mother Box.

1067
02:08:53,105 --> 02:08:54,606
The one he already has.

1068
02:08:54,731 --> 02:08:57,943
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1069
02:08:58,068 --> 02:09:00,571
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

1070
02:09:00,654 --> 02:09:01,947
If he doesn't already have it.

1071
02:09:05,492 --> 02:09:07,035
He doesn't have it.

1072
02:09:10,038 --> 02:09:11,331
I do.

1073
02:09:21,758 --> 02:09:23,886
Have you finished the conquest?

1074
02:09:23,969 --> 02:09:25,220
Not yet, DeSaad.

1075
02:09:25,304 --> 02:09:27,764
Then why do you summon me?

1076
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:29,391
I bring news.

1077
02:09:29,516 --> 02:09:32,519
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

1078
02:09:32,644 --> 02:09:37,816
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1079
02:09:37,941 --> 02:09:40,068
The Anti-Life Equation.

1080
02:09:40,152 --> 02:09:42,237
The key to controlling all life

1081
02:09:42,279 --> 02:09:44,781
and all will
throughout the multiverse.

1082
02:09:44,865 --> 02:09:48,118
He found it hidden on a primitive planet,
but before...

1083
02:09:48,201 --> 02:09:51,079
The story of the defiance
is well-known.

1084
02:09:51,204 --> 02:09:53,874
I have found
the primitive planet.

1085
02:09:53,999 --> 02:09:56,001
The world that fought back.

1086
02:09:56,126 --> 02:09:58,086
It is Earth.

1087
02:09:58,128 --> 02:10:00,380
The Anti-Life Equation is carved

1088
02:10:00,505 --> 02:10:04,551
into the surface
of this very world.

1089
02:10:08,138 --> 02:10:09,681
Are you certain?

1090
02:10:09,806 --> 02:10:10,849
I have seen it.

1091
02:10:10,974 --> 02:10:14,186
I have looked with my own eyes.

1092
02:10:15,937 --> 02:10:16,939
Anti-Life.

1093
02:10:57,729 --> 02:10:59,398
My lord.

1094
02:11:00,857 --> 02:11:04,736
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1095
02:11:04,861 --> 02:11:09,032
My lord, I am
but your humble servant.

1096
02:11:09,116 --> 02:11:11,994
Can it be true
that you have found it?

1097
02:11:12,077 --> 02:11:14,913
I have, great one.

1098
02:11:15,038 --> 02:11:17,999
The lost world is Earth.

1099
02:11:18,125 --> 02:11:22,337
Anti-Life is here.

1100
02:11:22,379 --> 02:11:25,716
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

1101
02:11:25,841 --> 02:11:29,011
synchronize The Unity, and
when this world is scorched,

1102
02:11:29,094 --> 02:11:32,472
I will come for my great prize.

1103
02:11:33,223 --> 02:11:36,393
You will come to Earth?

1104
02:11:36,476 --> 02:11:40,897
I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust

1105
02:11:41,022 --> 02:11:42,441
looking for Anti-Life.

1106
02:11:42,566 --> 02:11:45,944
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1107
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:49,239
I will stride across their bones

1108
02:11:49,322 --> 02:11:51,908
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

1109
02:11:51,992 --> 02:11:54,786
And all of existence

1110
02:11:54,911 --> 02:11:58,206
shall be mine.

1111
02:12:01,752 --> 02:12:05,714
It shall be so, my master.

1112
02:12:09,926 --> 02:12:11,553
So cool.

1113
02:12:11,636 --> 02:12:14,598
From the outside, it looks like
this building was abandoned.

1114
02:12:18,018 --> 02:12:19,770
It wants to fly.

1115
02:12:20,979 --> 02:12:22,981
You talk to machines?

1116
02:12:23,106 --> 02:12:25,150
I speak to intelligence.

1117
02:12:25,275 --> 02:12:26,443
This one's saying she can't fly

1118
02:12:26,526 --> 02:12:28,153
because of a software issue,

1119
02:12:28,278 --> 02:12:30,405
but I could fix it
with a little time.

1120
02:12:39,873 --> 02:12:42,417
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

1121
02:12:42,501 --> 02:12:44,961
I could feel
the other two boxes.

1122
02:12:45,045 --> 02:12:46,922
I know they're awake,

1123
02:12:47,005 --> 02:12:48,548
but I can't see where they are.

1124
02:12:48,673 --> 02:12:50,801
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

1125
02:12:50,926 --> 02:12:52,969
Even if we knew,

1126
02:12:53,053 --> 02:12:56,306
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1127
02:12:58,308 --> 02:12:59,684
Maybe one.

1128
02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:02,229
Hmm, Superman.

1129
02:13:02,354 --> 02:13:04,022
As long as
the third box is asleep,

1130
02:13:04,147 --> 02:13:06,399
they can't see it,
only sense it.

1131
02:13:06,525 --> 02:13:08,777
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1132
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:10,278
No. That's just a strategy

1133
02:13:10,403 --> 02:13:12,364
to lose more slowly, not to win.

1134
02:13:12,489 --> 02:13:15,325
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

1135
02:13:15,408 --> 02:13:16,493
Why don't we just destroy it?

1136
02:13:16,618 --> 02:13:18,703
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.

1137
02:13:18,829 --> 02:13:20,747
They're an unknown form
of matter.

1138
02:13:20,872 --> 02:13:22,123
Oh, they love heat.

1139
02:13:22,165 --> 02:13:24,334
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

1140
02:13:24,459 --> 02:13:27,128
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

1141
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:28,463
Makes you think.

1142
02:13:28,547 --> 02:13:31,174
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

1143
02:13:31,299 --> 02:13:32,968
Are you trying to say something?

1144
02:13:33,051 --> 02:13:34,803
Oh, I'm saying it.

1145
02:13:34,886 --> 02:13:37,180
How do we know you're not
working for them?

1146
02:13:38,890 --> 02:13:40,934
It's a long story.

1147
02:13:41,059 --> 02:13:42,894
You got somewhere else to be?

1148
02:13:50,277 --> 02:13:51,736
The Nazis found the box

1149
02:13:51,862 --> 02:13:54,197
at the end
of the Second World War,

1150
02:13:54,281 --> 02:13:57,367
buried under
an Italian monastery.

1151
02:13:57,450 --> 02:13:59,786
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1152
02:13:59,911 --> 02:14:02,831
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

1153
02:14:02,873 --> 02:14:07,168
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1154
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:09,087
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

1155
02:14:09,212 --> 02:14:10,964
for 70 years

1156
02:14:11,089 --> 02:14:14,593
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

1157
02:14:15,886 --> 02:14:18,388
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

1158
02:14:18,471 --> 02:14:19,639
between the ship...

1159
02:14:20,891 --> 02:14:22,893
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1160
02:14:23,059 --> 02:14:26,730
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

1161
02:14:26,855 --> 02:14:28,899
Different civilizations,

1162
02:14:28,982 --> 02:14:32,027
similar properties.

1163
02:14:32,110 --> 02:14:35,530
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1164
02:14:35,655 --> 02:14:39,117
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

1165
02:14:39,242 --> 02:14:41,244
And so did.

1166
02:14:43,288 --> 02:14:44,456
Then...

1167
02:14:46,416 --> 02:14:49,461
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

1168
02:14:49,586 --> 02:14:52,797
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

1169
02:14:52,923 --> 02:14:55,508
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

1170
02:15:11,483 --> 02:15:13,568
He unleashed an alien technology

1171
02:15:13,693 --> 02:15:16,488
he didn't fully understand.

1172
02:15:16,613 --> 02:15:19,282
He used that power
to keep me alive.

1173
02:15:22,786 --> 02:15:24,579
Alive...

1174
02:15:24,621 --> 02:15:26,790
but turned into this.

1175
02:15:29,459 --> 02:15:31,878
The box went back to sleep

1176
02:15:32,629 --> 02:15:34,547
and he never returned it.

1177
02:15:36,883 --> 02:15:39,302
That researcher was Silas Stone.

1178
02:15:40,887 --> 02:15:42,555
My father.

1179
02:15:45,809 --> 02:15:47,435
Wait,

1180
02:15:47,519 --> 02:15:50,814
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1181
02:15:50,981 --> 02:15:53,316
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

1182
02:15:53,483 --> 02:15:55,777
They're change machines.

1183
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:59,030
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

1184
02:15:59,155 --> 02:16:01,074
alive or dead.

1185
02:16:01,199 --> 02:16:03,618
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1186
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:05,412
regenerate, reinstate.

1187
02:16:05,537 --> 02:16:06,955
Reinstate?

1188
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:08,498
A box has the power

1189
02:16:08,581 --> 02:16:10,500
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1190
02:16:10,667 --> 02:16:12,502
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1191
02:16:12,627 --> 02:16:13,753
can't be created or destroyed,

1192
02:16:13,878 --> 02:16:15,880
their relations just transform.

1193
02:16:16,006 --> 02:16:18,842
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1194
02:16:18,925 --> 02:16:21,511
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1195
02:16:21,636 --> 02:16:25,849
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1196
02:16:27,726 --> 02:16:29,477
But a Mother Box...

1197
02:16:29,602 --> 02:16:31,980
...turns smoke
back into a house.

1198
02:16:37,819 --> 02:16:40,572
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

1199
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:44,534
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

1200
02:17:11,561 --> 02:17:12,854
Who is it?

1201
02:17:13,438 --> 02:17:14,731
Martha.

1202
02:17:19,402 --> 02:17:20,737
Hi.

1203
02:17:22,489 --> 02:17:23,948
Hi.

1204
02:17:32,916 --> 02:17:34,501
I went to the Daily Planet

1205
02:17:34,626 --> 02:17:38,088
to finally pick up
Clark's things.

1206
02:17:39,506 --> 02:17:42,926
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

1207
02:17:45,595 --> 02:17:47,430
I lost the farm.

1208
02:17:48,765 --> 02:17:51,017
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

1209
02:17:52,352 --> 02:17:53,728
Truth is, the house is too big

1210
02:17:53,853 --> 02:17:56,564
for me to live in
by myself anyway.

1211
02:17:56,689 --> 02:17:59,609
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1212
02:17:59,692 --> 02:18:01,820
for as long as you need.

1213
02:18:02,779 --> 02:18:05,698
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

1214
02:18:07,075 --> 02:18:09,369
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1215
02:18:09,494 --> 02:18:11,454
right by the diner.

1216
02:18:11,538 --> 02:18:12,956
I'm not here for help.

1217
02:18:14,124 --> 02:18:16,626
I'm here because

1218
02:18:16,751 --> 02:18:19,462
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

1219
02:18:20,672 --> 02:18:23,758
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

1220
02:18:28,430 --> 02:18:30,098
I can't.

1221
02:18:36,855 --> 02:18:39,524
The whole world is mourning.

1222
02:18:40,817 --> 02:18:43,111
Grieving over a symbol.

1223
02:18:43,236 --> 02:18:47,490
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."

1224
02:18:48,408 --> 02:18:50,451
I hear what people say.

1225
02:18:50,535 --> 02:18:52,537
They talk like they knew him.

1226
02:18:53,538 --> 02:18:55,957
But they didn't know Clark.

1227
02:18:57,417 --> 02:18:59,711
And I can't stop them

1228
02:18:59,836 --> 02:19:04,215
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

1229
02:19:06,259 --> 02:19:08,678
You're the only one who knows.

1230
02:19:08,803 --> 02:19:11,514
Who feels what I do.

1231
02:19:12,557 --> 02:19:15,727
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

1232
02:19:18,688 --> 02:19:22,192
I came all this way
because I wanted...

1233
02:19:22,275 --> 02:19:24,235
because I wanted to see you.

1234
02:19:25,487 --> 02:19:27,488
Tell you...

1235
02:19:27,530 --> 02:19:29,616
I understand.

1236
02:19:31,367 --> 02:19:33,328
I...

1237
02:19:33,453 --> 02:19:37,498
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1238
02:19:41,127 --> 02:19:43,087
And I just miss him.

1239
02:19:44,255 --> 02:19:46,674
I miss him so much.

1240
02:19:53,223 --> 02:19:54,891
So do I, sweetheart.

1241
02:19:59,354 --> 02:20:04,234
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1242
02:20:07,737 --> 02:20:10,615
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1243
02:20:12,784 --> 02:20:15,161
Come back to the living.

1244
02:20:54,951 --> 02:20:58,037
The world needs you, too, Lois.

1245
02:21:01,666 --> 02:21:03,001
The dead are dead.

1246
02:21:03,126 --> 02:21:05,128
The box brought Victor back.

1247
02:21:05,253 --> 02:21:06,713
Victor wasn't dead.

1248
02:21:06,838 --> 02:21:08,631
Life is either one or zero.

1249
02:21:08,756 --> 02:21:11,718
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

1250
02:21:11,843 --> 02:21:13,469
Can you operate this box,
Victor?

1251
02:21:13,594 --> 02:21:14,887
Of course.

1252
02:21:15,013 --> 02:21:17,307
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1253
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:19,642
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

1254
02:21:21,227 --> 02:21:22,812
Okay, but...

1255
02:21:22,979 --> 02:21:27,275
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1256
02:21:27,317 --> 02:21:28,610
What do we have to lose?

1257
02:21:28,735 --> 02:21:31,195
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

1258
02:21:31,321 --> 02:21:32,739
As soon as it wakes up...

1259
02:21:32,864 --> 02:21:35,325
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1260
02:21:35,491 --> 02:21:37,952
activates The Unity.
The end.

1261
02:21:38,036 --> 02:21:40,371
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1262
02:21:40,496 --> 02:21:42,665
to a bunch of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

1263
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:45,168
Even if Superman could return,

1264
02:21:45,335 --> 02:21:47,462
who's to say
that he could defeat them?

1265
02:21:47,545 --> 02:21:49,547
The Mother Box did.

1266
02:21:49,672 --> 02:21:51,841
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

1267
02:21:51,966 --> 02:21:54,802
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

1268
02:21:54,927 --> 02:21:56,846
Didn't call out to Steppenwolf.

1269
02:21:56,929 --> 02:21:58,514
None of the boxes did.
Not until...

1270
02:21:58,639 --> 02:22:00,683
Not until Superman died.

1271
02:22:00,850 --> 02:22:03,144
Not until Superman died.

1272
02:22:03,269 --> 02:22:05,229
It's like they were
afraid of him?

1273
02:22:05,355 --> 02:22:08,358
Yes, they were afraid of him.

1274
02:22:11,402 --> 02:22:13,196
This is the only way.

1275
02:22:14,530 --> 02:22:18,701
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1276
02:22:34,884 --> 02:22:36,886
Cross this one off
the bucket list.

1277
02:22:36,969 --> 02:22:40,973
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

1278
02:22:42,642 --> 02:22:45,353
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

1279
02:22:46,104 --> 02:22:47,397
We could.

1280
02:22:54,904 --> 02:22:56,739
He was my hero.

1281
02:22:59,283 --> 02:23:00,410
All right.

1282
02:23:03,955 --> 02:23:07,208
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

1283
02:23:07,291 --> 02:23:08,459
Half-Atlantean.

1284
02:23:10,253 --> 02:23:13,464
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1285
02:23:13,589 --> 02:23:17,719
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1286
02:23:17,802 --> 02:23:20,638
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

1287
02:23:20,763 --> 02:23:22,932
Hate is useless.

1288
02:23:26,102 --> 02:23:27,270
Yep.

1289
02:23:28,604 --> 02:23:30,231
No, thank you.

1290
02:23:34,652 --> 02:23:35,778
You know, my father told me

1291
02:23:35,903 --> 02:23:37,822
there's a saying in Atlantis...

1292
02:23:39,282 --> 02:23:41,576
"None are taken back
from the darkness.

1293
02:23:41,659 --> 02:23:42,869
"Not without..."

1294
02:23:42,994 --> 02:23:44,495
"Not without
giving one up in return."

1295
02:23:46,747 --> 02:23:48,332
We say the same thing.

1296
02:23:50,918 --> 02:23:52,670
How about that?

1297
02:23:52,795 --> 02:23:54,839
Wonder Woman.

1298
02:23:55,965 --> 02:23:57,258
What do you think, man?

1299
02:23:57,341 --> 02:24:00,136
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

1300
02:24:00,261 --> 02:24:03,097
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1301
02:24:04,807 --> 02:24:06,851
Every guy's a younger guy.

1302
02:24:08,644 --> 02:24:09,729
Jesus.

1303
02:24:11,314 --> 02:24:13,107
Oh, Christ.

1304
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:18,070
Oh, bloody...

1305
02:24:19,363 --> 02:24:20,448
Any luck?

1306
02:24:20,490 --> 02:24:21,866
If by "luck" you mean

1307
02:24:21,991 --> 02:24:24,785
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1308
02:24:24,911 --> 02:24:27,121
then, no. No luck.

1309
02:24:27,872 --> 02:24:29,332
It's okay.

1310
02:24:29,415 --> 02:24:31,375
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1311
02:24:31,501 --> 02:24:32,627
to the Kryptonian ship.

1312
02:24:32,752 --> 02:24:34,003
It's basically
an organic computer.

1313
02:24:34,128 --> 02:24:35,838
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

1314
02:24:36,005 --> 02:24:38,591
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?

1315
02:24:38,716 --> 02:24:39,967
Something like that.

1316
02:24:40,092 --> 02:24:43,888
Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

1317
02:24:50,394 --> 02:24:52,021
Master Wayne...

1318
02:24:53,898 --> 02:24:55,274
you did it!

1319
02:24:55,399 --> 02:24:58,945
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1320
02:24:59,070 --> 02:25:02,156
You've fulfilled your promise.

1321
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:06,160
But to try to do that...
I mean...

1322
02:25:06,285 --> 02:25:09,205
your guilt's
overcome your reason.

1323
02:25:09,372 --> 02:25:11,499
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

1324
02:25:11,541 --> 02:25:14,877
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

1325
02:25:15,002 --> 02:25:17,380
not on reason.

1326
02:25:17,505 --> 02:25:21,843
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

1327
02:25:21,968 --> 02:25:24,095
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

1328
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:27,181
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

1329
02:25:27,265 --> 02:25:29,809
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

1330
02:25:29,934 --> 02:25:31,727
then don't wave
the red cape at it.

1331
02:25:31,811 --> 02:25:33,521
You do when it's this red cape.

1332
02:25:33,604 --> 02:25:35,898
This red cape charges back.

1333
02:25:50,538 --> 02:25:51,622
Okay.

1334
02:25:58,462 --> 02:26:00,965
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

1335
02:26:01,090 --> 02:26:02,592
Everyone's clear, including you.

1336
02:26:02,758 --> 02:26:05,428
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1337
02:26:05,511 --> 02:26:07,430
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1338
02:26:07,513 --> 02:26:08,472
Absolutely.

1339
02:26:12,310 --> 02:26:13,561
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.

1340
02:26:13,644 --> 02:26:16,272
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

1341
02:26:16,397 --> 02:26:17,940
If you need
more medical attention...

1342
02:26:18,024 --> 02:26:21,944
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1343
02:26:22,028 --> 02:26:23,446
- Definitely not "A."
- Okay.

1344
02:26:23,571 --> 02:26:26,616
Or... "B"?

1345
02:26:28,159 --> 02:26:29,535
Let me see "A" again?

1346
02:26:35,041 --> 02:26:38,336
Right. We should get dressed.

1347
02:26:40,296 --> 02:26:42,423
I'm always dressed.

1348
02:27:09,575 --> 02:27:10,660
ID?

1349
02:27:10,785 --> 02:27:12,078
ID.

1350
02:27:15,039 --> 02:27:16,332
Aye, aye.

1351
02:27:18,584 --> 02:27:19,960
"Aye, aye"?

1352
02:27:42,984 --> 02:27:44,235
Okay.

1353
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:46,570
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1354
02:27:53,619 --> 02:27:54,537
Doc!

1355
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:56,080
They let you out of quarantine.

1356
02:27:56,205 --> 02:27:57,623
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1357
02:27:57,748 --> 02:27:59,875
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

1358
02:28:00,001 --> 02:28:01,293
with the electron-laser.

1359
02:28:01,419 --> 02:28:03,546
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

1360
02:28:18,519 --> 02:28:21,480
Victor, clear this place out.

1361
02:28:21,605 --> 02:28:22,940
Done.

1362
02:28:26,736 --> 02:28:29,447
Code Red.
Contamination breach.

1363
02:28:29,572 --> 02:28:32,783
All personnel
evacuate immediately.

1364
02:28:32,908 --> 02:28:35,202
Bio red five.

1365
02:28:35,286 --> 02:28:37,663
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

1366
02:28:37,788 --> 02:28:40,708
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

1367
02:28:40,791 --> 02:28:42,042
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1368
02:28:42,168 --> 02:28:44,211
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.

1369
02:28:44,253 --> 02:28:45,629
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.

1370
02:28:45,755 --> 02:28:47,089
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1371
02:28:47,214 --> 02:28:48,549
- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.

1372
02:28:48,632 --> 02:28:49,717
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!

1373
02:28:49,759 --> 02:28:51,844
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1374
02:28:51,969 --> 02:28:54,930
Remain calm and
proceed to the nearest exit.

1375
02:29:01,312 --> 02:29:03,105
Attention, all personnel.

1376
02:29:03,230 --> 02:29:06,108
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!

1377
02:29:06,192 --> 02:29:07,943
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1378
02:29:08,027 --> 02:29:09,612
Everybody out! Go!

1379
02:29:29,799 --> 02:29:32,593
Yes! Gotcha!

1380
02:29:32,718 --> 02:29:35,513
Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

1381
02:29:35,638 --> 02:29:38,015
- Go ahead, Dr. Stone.
- This is a false alarm.

1382
02:29:38,140 --> 02:29:40,935
Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert...

1383
02:29:50,903 --> 02:29:52,404
Victor.

1384
02:29:53,864 --> 02:29:56,367
Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.

1385
02:29:57,201 --> 02:29:58,285
I was mistaken.

1386
02:29:58,369 --> 02:29:59,578
The alarm's legit.

1387
02:29:59,703 --> 02:30:01,372
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

1388
02:30:01,497 --> 02:30:04,291
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

1389
02:30:04,375 --> 02:30:05,751
Roger that, sir.

1390
02:30:15,845 --> 02:30:17,513
Get the civilians out!

1391
02:30:17,638 --> 02:30:18,806
Let's go! Let's go!

1392
02:30:23,185 --> 02:30:24,353
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.

1393
02:30:24,478 --> 02:30:25,646
- Everybody?
- Yes.

1394
02:30:58,929 --> 02:31:00,306
This way.

1395
02:31:10,816 --> 02:31:13,569
It knows he's here.

1396
02:31:13,736 --> 02:31:15,863
Ooh, that's intense.

1397
02:31:20,242 --> 02:31:22,369
This is amazing.

1398
02:31:23,078 --> 02:31:24,246
This is crazy.

1399
02:31:24,371 --> 02:31:26,290
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1400
02:31:26,415 --> 02:31:28,876
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

1401
02:33:54,730 --> 02:33:56,732
Systems coming online.

1402
02:33:59,485 --> 02:34:01,779
Welcome, Victor.

1403
02:34:01,904 --> 02:34:03,822
Would you like
to assume command?

1404
02:34:03,947 --> 02:34:04,907
I'm in.

1405
02:34:14,083 --> 02:34:16,418
The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.

1406
02:34:16,585 --> 02:34:18,128
I can override
the security protocols,

1407
02:34:18,253 --> 02:34:19,963
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

1408
02:34:20,089 --> 02:34:21,465
that Luthor's
power surges caused

1409
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:22,716
to the primary capacitors.

1410
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:23,759
English.

1411
02:34:23,926 --> 02:34:26,428
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

1412
02:34:26,553 --> 02:34:28,597
I might be able to do it.

1413
02:34:30,724 --> 02:34:32,684
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

1414
02:34:32,810 --> 02:34:34,061
I don't like to break this rule,

1415
02:34:34,144 --> 02:34:35,938
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

1416
02:34:36,021 --> 02:34:37,606
Look, crazy things
happen to time,

1417
02:34:37,773 --> 02:34:40,275
but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.

1418
02:34:40,359 --> 02:34:42,152
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

1419
02:34:42,277 --> 02:34:44,613
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

1420
02:34:44,780 --> 02:34:47,449
I might be able to wake
the box, if that's...

1421
02:34:47,574 --> 02:34:49,243
still what we want?

1422
02:34:49,326 --> 02:34:50,828
It is. Do it.

1423
02:34:55,582 --> 02:34:56,917
Hey, Miss Lane.

1424
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:57,793
Morning.

1425
02:34:57,960 --> 02:34:59,461
I didn't think you were coming.

1426
02:35:00,379 --> 02:35:01,964
One last time.

1427
02:35:18,897 --> 02:35:22,651
I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...

1428
02:35:22,818 --> 02:35:23,986
I'm in position.

1429
02:35:26,738 --> 02:35:29,324
- Ready to initiate
- drop sequence.

1430
02:35:29,408 --> 02:35:31,034
The Mother Box is ready.

1431
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:52,139
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.

1432
02:35:52,222 --> 02:35:54,141
- This action
- is irreversible.

1433
02:35:54,224 --> 02:35:55,559
It's afraid. It knows
Steppenwolf will come for it.

1434
02:35:55,684 --> 02:35:57,478
We know that already.
Continue.

1435
02:35:57,561 --> 02:36:00,189
I strongly advise
against activation.

1436
02:36:00,272 --> 02:36:01,940
Barry, I'm initiating
the countdown.

1437
02:36:02,065 --> 02:36:03,692
- This action
- is irreversible.

1438
02:36:03,859 --> 02:36:04,985
- Five...
- Five...

1439
02:36:05,068 --> 02:36:06,487
- Five...
- Apokoliptian technology

1440
02:36:06,570 --> 02:36:07,613
- is hostile.
- This is a bad idea.

1441
02:36:07,738 --> 02:36:08,447
No, it isn't.
Keep going.

1442
02:36:08,572 --> 02:36:09,531
Four...

1443
02:36:09,698 --> 02:36:11,158
- Four...
- Four...

1444
02:36:11,283 --> 02:36:12,701
I strongly advise
against activation.

1445
02:36:12,826 --> 02:36:14,036
- We need to abort, now.
- Just do it.

1446
02:36:14,203 --> 02:36:15,329
- Three...
- Three...

1447
02:36:15,412 --> 02:36:16,413
Three...

1448
02:36:16,538 --> 02:36:18,248
- Two...
- Two...

1449
02:36:18,373 --> 02:36:20,292
- Two...
- This course is irreversible.

1450
02:36:20,417 --> 02:36:21,710
- One.
- One.

1451
02:36:22,544 --> 02:36:23,962
One.

1452
02:36:24,087 --> 02:36:25,380
- This action
- is irreversible.

1453
02:37:54,386 --> 02:37:55,971
- Victor?
- No.

1454
02:37:56,972 --> 02:37:57,931
Go?

1455
02:39:28,438 --> 02:39:31,191
- The future
- has taken root in the present.

1456
02:39:31,316 --> 02:39:33,193
Get down!

1457
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:18,965
He's back.

1458
02:41:45,617 --> 02:41:48,537
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.

1459
02:41:50,705 --> 02:41:52,165
What?

1460
02:42:07,055 --> 02:42:08,223
Victor?

1461
02:42:09,432 --> 02:42:10,433
Victor?

1462
02:42:12,727 --> 02:42:14,604
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

1463
02:42:14,729 --> 02:42:16,356
It's my auto-defense system.

1464
02:42:16,439 --> 02:42:17,566
It senses danger.

1465
02:42:17,649 --> 02:42:18,900
Victor, no! Victor!

1466
02:42:19,025 --> 02:42:20,944
- I can't control it.
- Don't!

1467
02:42:33,123 --> 02:42:34,416
Kal-El, no!

1468
02:42:42,591 --> 02:42:44,885
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

1469
02:42:51,891 --> 02:42:54,561
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

1470
02:43:25,008 --> 02:43:28,928
Kal-El,
the last Son of Krypton...

1471
02:43:29,846 --> 02:43:32,140
remember who you are.

1472
02:43:33,683 --> 02:43:34,934
Tell me who you...

1473
02:45:09,904 --> 02:45:13,074
Let's go!

1474
02:45:20,081 --> 02:45:21,541
You should probably move.

1475
02:45:25,044 --> 02:45:26,212
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1476
02:45:26,296 --> 02:45:29,090
Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.

1477
02:46:21,059 --> 02:46:23,269
Please don't make me do this.

1478
02:46:55,844 --> 02:46:57,178
Clark.

1479
02:46:58,054 --> 02:46:59,347
Clark, no.

1480
02:47:10,859 --> 02:47:12,068
Clark.

1481
02:47:12,193 --> 02:47:14,028
No.

1482
02:47:14,195 --> 02:47:15,905
This world needs you.

1483
02:47:21,160 --> 02:47:22,495
Clark.

1484
02:47:22,620 --> 02:47:23,705
Clark.

1485
02:47:23,788 --> 02:47:25,874
Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1486
02:47:27,375 --> 02:47:28,668
Clark.

1487
02:47:32,046 --> 02:47:33,506
Please.

1488
02:48:07,749 --> 02:48:08,791
Please.

1489
02:48:19,969 --> 02:48:21,262
Please.

1490
02:48:21,930 --> 02:48:24,057
Just go.

1491
02:48:24,140 --> 02:48:25,308
Yeah.

1492
02:48:26,017 --> 02:48:27,435
Let's go.

1493
02:48:59,968 --> 02:49:02,136
I'm so sorry.

1494
02:49:11,354 --> 02:49:12,438
Take cover!

1495
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:15,108
- He's coming.
- The Mother Box.

1496
02:49:15,149 --> 02:49:16,401
Where is it?

1497
02:49:26,953 --> 02:49:28,288
Come on.

1498
02:49:29,038 --> 02:49:30,873
Come on.

1499
02:49:55,565 --> 02:49:59,318
Attention,
security breach detected.

1500
02:49:59,444 --> 02:50:01,654
Sector Four, Level Three.

1501
02:50:01,738 --> 02:50:04,741
Implement lockdown
procedures immediately.

1502
02:50:33,227 --> 02:50:34,854
Give me the Mother Box.

1503
02:50:48,076 --> 02:50:49,577
No, no, no.

1504
02:50:52,038 --> 02:50:53,748
Dad, wait! Don't!

1505
02:51:34,038 --> 02:51:36,958
So begins the end.

1506
02:51:42,547 --> 02:51:43,965
Victor?

1507
02:51:46,259 --> 02:51:49,720
Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

1508
02:51:55,518 --> 02:51:56,853
Victor?

1509
02:51:58,020 --> 02:51:59,397
He's dead.

1510
02:51:59,522 --> 02:52:00,648
What?

1511
02:52:01,566 --> 02:52:02,900
My father.

1512
02:52:04,318 --> 02:52:07,780
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

1513
02:52:07,864 --> 02:52:09,490
Oh, my God.

1514
02:52:16,080 --> 02:52:18,124
His father's dead 'cause of us.

1515
02:52:18,249 --> 02:52:20,042
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

1516
02:52:20,168 --> 02:52:21,627
It wasn't a bad idea.

1517
02:52:21,752 --> 02:52:24,088
We needed Superman.
We still do.

1518
02:52:24,213 --> 02:52:26,674
Well, whatever
returned, it isn't Superman.

1519
02:52:26,757 --> 02:52:30,011
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

1520
02:52:30,094 --> 02:52:31,637
It is him.

1521
02:52:31,679 --> 02:52:34,182
He recognized Lois Lane.

1522
02:52:34,348 --> 02:52:36,476
- Who?
- The woman he loves.

1523
02:52:36,559 --> 02:52:38,853
- He remembers her.
- Nah.

1524
02:52:39,020 --> 02:52:40,855
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.

1525
02:52:40,938 --> 02:52:42,648
It's called instinct, Diana.

1526
02:52:49,822 --> 02:52:51,699
Wait, where did Steppenwolf go?

1527
02:52:51,824 --> 02:52:53,451
He's gone back to his base

1528
02:52:53,576 --> 02:52:55,119
to assemble the three boxes.

1529
02:52:55,244 --> 02:52:56,704
And we don't know
where his base is.

1530
02:52:56,871 --> 02:52:58,539
- Or how long until...
- Hours.

1531
02:52:58,623 --> 02:53:00,208
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,

1532
02:53:00,291 --> 02:53:03,544
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

1533
02:53:03,628 --> 02:53:05,838
This is not your...

1534
02:53:08,007 --> 02:53:09,508
He knew.

1535
02:53:09,592 --> 02:53:11,135
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1536
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:13,221
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...

1537
02:53:13,304 --> 02:53:15,264
he was trying to superheat it.

1538
02:53:15,389 --> 02:53:16,641
He made the core
the hottest thing

1539
02:53:16,766 --> 02:53:17,892
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.

1540
02:53:18,017 --> 02:53:19,018
Now, anything that hot
would have to...

1541
02:53:19,101 --> 02:53:20,311
Blink off the charts

1542
02:53:20,436 --> 02:53:22,563
on a thermal imaging system.

1543
02:53:22,730 --> 02:53:26,025
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

1544
02:53:26,108 --> 02:53:28,069
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

1545
02:53:28,194 --> 02:53:30,363
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.

1546
02:53:30,488 --> 02:53:31,864
I'm already on it.

1547
02:53:31,948 --> 02:53:33,950
I'm sorry.
You have a satellite?

1548
02:53:34,075 --> 02:53:35,368
I have six.

1549
02:53:35,451 --> 02:53:36,702
Right.

1550
02:53:38,120 --> 02:53:40,540
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.

1551
02:54:04,814 --> 02:54:07,066
You brought us here.

1552
02:54:07,191 --> 02:54:08,317
You remembered.

1553
02:54:09,277 --> 02:54:10,945
This is home.

1554
02:54:12,697 --> 02:54:14,073
You spoke.

1555
02:54:18,119 --> 02:54:19,996
Did I not before?

1556
02:54:53,863 --> 02:54:56,657
Your mother got behind
on the payments.

1557
02:54:57,867 --> 02:55:00,036
She never told anyone.

1558
02:55:01,579 --> 02:55:03,372
I don't understand.

1559
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:09,003
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1560
02:55:12,131 --> 02:55:13,382
Here.

1561
02:55:28,397 --> 02:55:30,066
She loved it here.

1562
02:55:40,743 --> 02:55:42,411
So did I.

1563
02:55:44,413 --> 02:55:45,956
So did I.

1564
02:56:11,524 --> 02:56:12,775
Wow!

1565
02:56:12,900 --> 02:56:14,568
This is awesome.

1566
02:56:14,735 --> 02:56:16,278
Brought some friends.

1567
02:56:22,785 --> 02:56:25,246
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1568
02:56:25,371 --> 02:56:27,998
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

1569
02:56:28,124 --> 02:56:30,418
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.

1570
02:56:31,710 --> 02:56:33,879
Oh...

1571
02:56:36,841 --> 02:56:38,926
It's badass, Alfred.

1572
02:56:41,595 --> 02:56:44,140
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1573
02:56:44,265 --> 02:56:45,391
Great.

1574
02:56:45,516 --> 02:56:47,226
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

1575
02:56:49,937 --> 02:56:52,898
There's the
Mother Box, right there.

1576
02:56:52,940 --> 02:56:54,984
Go to visible spectrum.

1577
02:56:56,819 --> 02:56:58,946
Pozharnov.

1578
02:56:59,071 --> 02:57:01,949
Ghost city not far from Moscow.

1579
02:57:02,074 --> 02:57:03,325
It's been abandoned since

1580
02:57:03,451 --> 02:57:04,827
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

1581
02:57:04,952 --> 02:57:06,245
Not even the army goes in.

1582
02:57:06,328 --> 02:57:07,746
Right, it's probably
so radioactive

1583
02:57:07,872 --> 02:57:09,915
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

1584
02:57:09,957 --> 02:57:11,375
Not anymore.

1585
02:57:11,500 --> 02:57:13,252
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

1586
02:57:13,335 --> 02:57:14,378
Zoom.

1587
02:57:18,215 --> 02:57:19,758
What the hell is he building?

1588
02:57:19,842 --> 02:57:21,302
The Unity's in there.

1589
02:57:21,385 --> 02:57:22,762
We'll attack from above.

1590
02:57:22,845 --> 02:57:25,556
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,

1591
02:57:25,681 --> 02:57:27,308
only strengthen their bond.

1592
02:57:27,475 --> 02:57:28,809
What?
So we can't blow it up?

1593
02:57:28,893 --> 02:57:30,436
Not from the outside.

1594
02:57:31,937 --> 02:57:34,857
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.

1595
02:57:34,982 --> 02:57:36,358
Fuse with it.

1596
02:57:36,484 --> 02:57:37,818
Weaken its bond from the inside

1597
02:57:37,985 --> 02:57:39,236
so we can break it back
into three.

1598
02:57:39,361 --> 02:57:41,447
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

1599
02:57:41,489 --> 02:57:45,201
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

1600
02:57:45,326 --> 02:57:47,828
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

1601
02:57:47,912 --> 02:57:49,288
A billion years old.

1602
02:57:49,371 --> 02:57:51,457
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

1603
02:57:51,582 --> 02:57:54,001
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

1604
02:57:54,084 --> 02:57:56,337
Just get me in and get me time.

1605
02:57:56,504 --> 02:57:57,630
You could die, Victor.

1606
02:57:57,713 --> 02:58:00,174
If I don't, we all die.
Period.

1607
02:58:04,762 --> 02:58:06,555
I got nothing left.

1608
02:58:11,852 --> 02:58:14,021
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

1609
02:58:16,941 --> 02:58:18,526
That's what I'm gonna do.

1610
02:58:18,692 --> 02:58:21,028
Okay. So...

1611
02:58:21,153 --> 02:58:22,821
if Victor wants
to try to save the world

1612
02:58:22,863 --> 02:58:24,406
by fusing with the doom boxes,

1613
02:58:24,532 --> 02:58:27,034
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

1614
02:58:27,117 --> 02:58:29,995
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

1615
02:58:30,037 --> 02:58:32,498
Fighting the devil and his army

1616
02:58:32,581 --> 02:58:33,833
in hell.

1617
02:58:33,958 --> 02:58:36,001
I mean,
this guy's probably fought

1618
02:58:36,085 --> 02:58:38,337
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

1619
02:58:38,420 --> 02:58:40,089
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

1620
02:58:40,214 --> 02:58:41,841
And we have to assume he's won.

1621
02:58:41,882 --> 02:58:43,634
I don't care
how many demons he's fought

1622
02:58:43,759 --> 02:58:45,052
in how many hells...

1623
02:58:45,177 --> 02:58:48,889
he's never fought us.
Not us united.

1624
02:59:39,148 --> 02:59:40,816
Take that as a "yes."

1625
02:59:40,941 --> 02:59:42,401
What?

1626
02:59:45,821 --> 02:59:47,114
The ring.

1627
02:59:50,784 --> 02:59:52,369
You're really back.

1628
03:00:25,819 --> 03:00:28,155
I have a second chance, Lo.

1629
03:00:30,199 --> 03:00:32,951
And I am not gonna waste it.

1630
03:01:30,968 --> 03:01:32,177
Are you really you?

1631
03:01:32,261 --> 03:01:34,680
I'm really me, Ma.

1632
03:01:52,072 --> 03:01:54,241
Listen, Ma.

1633
03:01:55,576 --> 03:01:57,745
They wanted me back
for a reason.

1634
03:01:59,413 --> 03:02:01,206
I need to find out why.

1635
03:02:21,143 --> 03:02:22,644
How's Victor doing?

1636
03:02:26,940 --> 03:02:29,777
You know,
wanted to be by himself.

1637
03:02:31,278 --> 03:02:34,406
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

1638
03:02:34,490 --> 03:02:36,075
to go up against
the most powerful machines

1639
03:02:36,158 --> 03:02:37,534
in the universe.

1640
03:02:39,244 --> 03:02:40,788
It's not fair.

1641
03:02:42,456 --> 03:02:44,291
I thought you didn't care?

1642
03:02:45,667 --> 03:02:47,252
I never said that.

1643
03:03:00,015 --> 03:03:01,517
What is it?

1644
03:03:03,143 --> 03:03:05,187
Uh...

1645
03:03:05,312 --> 03:03:08,398
I had a dream,
like, I don't know,

1646
03:03:08,524 --> 03:03:11,110
almost like a premonition.

1647
03:03:11,235 --> 03:03:14,112
It was the end of the world

1648
03:03:14,196 --> 03:03:17,115
and Barry Allen was right here

1649
03:03:17,199 --> 03:03:21,328
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

1650
03:03:23,872 --> 03:03:27,209
She is... to Superman.

1651
03:03:28,085 --> 03:03:30,129
Every heart has one.

1652
03:03:30,254 --> 03:03:32,339
I think it's something more.

1653
03:03:33,048 --> 03:03:35,175
Something darker.

1654
03:03:39,138 --> 03:03:40,139
Master Wayne.

1655
03:03:40,222 --> 03:03:42,391
Master Wayne!

1656
03:03:42,516 --> 03:03:44,434
You need to see this.

1657
03:04:07,708 --> 03:04:09,293
You fixed it.

1658
03:04:09,418 --> 03:04:11,336
It wanted to fly.

1659
03:04:12,379 --> 03:04:13,881
Flight is its nature.

1660
03:04:13,964 --> 03:04:15,382
Yours, too.

1661
03:04:21,847 --> 03:04:24,016
He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.

1662
03:04:24,099 --> 03:04:26,351
What makes you so sure?

1663
03:04:26,393 --> 03:04:29,271
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1664
03:04:51,210 --> 03:04:52,836
At last.

1665
03:04:54,546 --> 03:04:57,466
Prepare for his arrival.

1666
03:04:59,176 --> 03:05:03,430
My redemption is nigh.

1667
03:05:11,146 --> 03:05:12,731
Unite.

1668
03:05:17,903 --> 03:05:20,447
Synchronize.

1669
03:06:04,533 --> 03:06:05,993
The satellites revealed

1670
03:06:06,076 --> 03:06:07,494
he's created a defensive dome.

1671
03:06:07,661 --> 03:06:08,870
It's a design flaw.

1672
03:06:08,996 --> 03:06:11,164
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.

1673
03:06:11,248 --> 03:06:13,458
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

1674
03:06:13,542 --> 03:06:15,127
Right, probably
'cause he didn't think

1675
03:06:15,210 --> 03:06:17,337
anyone would be that nuts.

1676
03:06:18,171 --> 03:06:19,464
Bruce is right.

1677
03:06:19,506 --> 03:06:21,008
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

1678
03:06:21,174 --> 03:06:23,635
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

1679
03:06:23,719 --> 03:06:25,512
What if the dome's
not destroyed?

1680
03:06:25,637 --> 03:06:27,014
It'll be destroyed.

1681
03:06:27,097 --> 03:06:28,974
Once Victor
is linked with The Unity

1682
03:06:29,057 --> 03:06:30,309
with Barry's help,

1683
03:06:30,434 --> 03:06:32,310
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

1684
03:06:32,394 --> 03:06:34,021
Remind me, how's that again?

1685
03:06:34,104 --> 03:06:35,522
Uh, with the power of love.

1686
03:06:35,689 --> 03:06:38,650
- Barry.
- With a catastrophic energy surge.

1687
03:06:38,734 --> 03:06:39,985
Good.

1688
03:06:40,152 --> 03:06:41,862
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

1689
03:06:41,945 --> 03:06:44,364
to generate
a charge of that size.

1690
03:06:44,531 --> 03:06:46,700
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

1691
03:06:46,783 --> 03:06:49,661
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

1692
03:06:49,786 --> 03:06:51,747
And, Victor, it's all up to you.

1693
03:06:51,872 --> 03:06:55,083
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

1694
03:06:55,208 --> 03:06:58,920
Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.

1695
03:06:59,046 --> 03:07:00,797
We have a plan.

1696
03:07:15,896 --> 03:07:17,981
The symbol
of the house of El means hope.

1697
03:07:18,106 --> 03:07:20,233
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief

1698
03:07:20,359 --> 03:07:22,361
in the potential of every

1699
03:07:22,362 --> 03:07:24,362
person to be a force for good.

1700
03:07:24,446 --> 03:07:25,864
Clark...

1701
03:07:25,947 --> 03:07:27,574
That's what you can bring them.

1702
03:07:27,699 --> 03:07:29,076
...you were
sent here for a reason.

1703
03:07:29,242 --> 03:07:30,827
You will give
the people of Earth

1704
03:07:30,952 --> 03:07:32,996
an ideal to strive towards.

1705
03:07:33,121 --> 03:07:34,247
And even if it takes you

1706
03:07:34,414 --> 03:07:36,041
the rest of your life,

1707
03:07:36,124 --> 03:07:37,668
you owe it to yourself to

1708
03:07:37,669 --> 03:07:39,211
find out what that reason is.

1709
03:07:39,294 --> 03:07:42,047
They will stumble,
they will fall.

1710
03:07:42,130 --> 03:07:44,091
- You're gonna
- have to make a choice.

1711
03:07:44,257 --> 03:07:46,760
- They will join you
- in the sun, Kal.

1712
03:07:46,927 --> 03:07:48,762
A choice
of whether to stand proud

1713
03:07:48,929 --> 03:07:50,889
in front of the human race
or not.

1714
03:07:50,972 --> 03:07:54,518
You will help them
accomplish wonders.

1715
03:08:11,284 --> 03:08:15,914
All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.

1716
03:08:15,956 --> 03:08:19,584
I'm so proud of you, son.

1717
03:08:19,626 --> 03:08:22,337
Your mother and I loved you.

1718
03:08:22,462 --> 03:08:23,797
Your mother and I knew

1719
03:08:23,880 --> 03:08:26,049
you would change the world.

1720
03:08:27,342 --> 03:08:30,095
Your heart was tested.

1721
03:08:30,178 --> 03:08:32,889
I know it's been hard, Clark.

1722
03:08:33,014 --> 03:08:35,976
But you gave hope
to their world.

1723
03:08:36,059 --> 03:08:39,437
You need
to show them who you are.

1724
03:08:39,521 --> 03:08:41,690
Love them, Kal.

1725
03:08:41,815 --> 03:08:44,109
The way we loved you.

1726
03:08:46,528 --> 03:08:47,779
Fly, son.

1727
03:08:48,655 --> 03:08:49,990
It's time.

1728
03:09:53,637 --> 03:09:54,930
I'm gonna take out that tower

1729
03:09:55,055 --> 03:09:56,973
and knock down that shield dome.

1730
03:09:57,098 --> 03:09:58,141
Whatever you see,

1731
03:09:59,434 --> 03:10:01,561
stick to the plan.

1732
03:10:03,063 --> 03:10:05,232
It's why I brought you together.

1733
03:10:45,105 --> 03:10:47,107
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

1734
03:10:49,985 --> 03:10:52,946
Just have to knock
a little louder.

1735
03:11:18,013 --> 03:11:19,472
Kill him!

1736
03:11:19,597 --> 03:11:22,350
Get to the carriage.
Defend The Unity.

1737
03:11:27,314 --> 03:11:28,606
Oh, shit.

1738
03:11:48,543 --> 03:11:49,919
The tower's down.

1739
03:11:51,463 --> 03:11:53,381
Do you read me?

1740
03:11:53,506 --> 03:11:54,758
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

1741
03:11:55,675 --> 03:11:57,135
Are you okay?

1742
03:11:58,345 --> 03:12:01,181
Bruce? Bruce?

1743
03:12:01,264 --> 03:12:02,140
Get to the reactor.

1744
03:12:02,223 --> 03:12:03,725
I'll lure as many
of these monsters

1745
03:12:03,850 --> 03:12:05,852
- away from you as I can.
- What does that mean?

1746
03:12:08,730 --> 03:12:10,690
Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.

1747
03:12:13,443 --> 03:12:14,527
They're here.

1748
03:12:14,611 --> 03:12:15,862
Bruce?

1749
03:12:18,698 --> 03:12:20,158
Comm went dead.

1750
03:12:21,743 --> 03:12:23,119
Let's go.

1751
03:13:01,908 --> 03:13:03,910
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

1752
03:14:23,531 --> 03:14:25,033
Critical damage.

1753
03:15:04,906 --> 03:15:06,241
You really are outta your mind.

1754
03:15:33,017 --> 03:15:34,352
You're welcome.

1755
03:15:34,435 --> 03:15:35,979
My man.

1756
03:17:08,738 --> 03:17:10,490
Yeah, we got this.

1757
03:17:10,615 --> 03:17:11,824
You go do your thing.

1758
03:18:07,755 --> 03:18:09,340
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1759
03:18:11,092 --> 03:18:12,468
Master Kent.

1760
03:18:14,303 --> 03:18:16,097
He said you'd come.

1761
03:18:17,473 --> 03:18:21,227
Now, let's hope
you're not too late.

1762
03:18:31,946 --> 03:18:34,323
Hey!

1763
03:18:42,248 --> 03:18:43,666
Remember me?

1764
03:18:46,127 --> 03:18:47,628
Round two?

1765
03:18:48,254 --> 03:18:49,547
Hell yeah.

1766
03:19:10,985 --> 03:19:12,445
Shall we?

1767
03:19:13,279 --> 03:19:15,531
Tell me, Amazon,

1768
03:19:15,656 --> 03:19:19,702
why did you
abandon your own sisters

1769
03:19:19,827 --> 03:19:22,413
only to cast your lot
with these creatures

1770
03:19:22,497 --> 03:19:25,958
clinging to their puny lives?

1771
03:19:26,084 --> 03:19:29,045
You weren't there
to protect them from me.

1772
03:19:29,170 --> 03:19:31,088
And, sadly, you could have.

1773
03:20:12,171 --> 03:20:13,881
Barry, I'm in position.

1774
03:20:32,567 --> 03:20:35,903
Okay.
I built the charge.

1775
03:20:36,028 --> 03:20:36,988
You call it.

1776
03:20:38,197 --> 03:20:40,032
Barry, on one.

1777
03:20:40,157 --> 03:20:42,368
Three, two...

1778
03:20:45,246 --> 03:20:46,998
Get the hell off me!

1779
03:20:47,123 --> 03:20:48,583
Victor!

1780
03:21:24,660 --> 03:21:26,287
Victor!

1781
03:21:29,999 --> 03:21:32,376
I watched your island burn,

1782
03:21:32,501 --> 03:21:36,088
your sisters
begging for their lives.

1783
03:21:36,255 --> 03:21:38,841
As did your mother.

1784
03:21:38,966 --> 03:21:39,926
Liar.

1785
03:22:05,534 --> 03:22:07,703
I can't maintain this!

1786
03:22:08,454 --> 03:22:09,622
Victor!

1787
03:22:31,644 --> 03:22:33,980
Victor, I can't hold this!

1788
03:22:40,486 --> 03:22:42,905
For Darkseid.

1789
03:22:46,909 --> 03:22:49,370
Not impressed.

1790
03:23:33,789 --> 03:23:34,957
All right.

1791
03:23:35,082 --> 03:23:36,709
Kal-El.

1792
03:24:14,955 --> 03:24:17,374
Barry, I'm connected
to The Unity.

1793
03:24:17,416 --> 03:24:19,585
I need the charge to get inside.

1794
03:24:41,440 --> 03:24:42,650
Barry?

1795
03:24:43,442 --> 03:24:45,236
Barry, are you okay?

1796
03:24:46,654 --> 03:24:47,738
Barry!

1797
03:24:47,863 --> 03:24:49,031
I got the wind
knocked out of me.

1798
03:24:49,156 --> 03:24:51,909
Need a few seconds, that's all!

1799
03:25:08,801 --> 03:25:11,345
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!

1800
03:25:11,470 --> 03:25:13,472
Okay, okay.

1801
03:25:13,597 --> 03:25:16,308
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.

1802
03:25:16,434 --> 03:25:18,144
Heal. Heal.

1803
03:25:44,003 --> 03:25:45,671
Barry!

1804
03:25:58,434 --> 03:26:00,186
It's too late.

1805
03:26:01,437 --> 03:26:02,980
Oh, no.

1806
03:26:07,193 --> 03:26:08,861
He's here!

1807
03:26:38,265 --> 03:26:39,516
Okay.

1808
03:26:39,642 --> 03:26:40,684
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.

1809
03:26:40,768 --> 03:26:41,852
Far beyond the speed of light.

1810
03:26:41,894 --> 03:26:43,062
You gotta break the rule, Barry,

1811
03:26:43,229 --> 03:26:45,272
and you gotta do it now.

1812
03:26:58,369 --> 03:27:00,079
Dad...

1813
03:27:03,791 --> 03:27:06,252
whatever happens,
I want you to know

1814
03:27:08,837 --> 03:27:11,006
your kid was one of them, Dad.

1815
03:27:13,968 --> 03:27:16,095
One of the best of the best.

1816
03:28:11,525 --> 03:28:14,111
Make your own future.

1817
03:28:20,534 --> 03:28:22,661
Make your own past.

1818
03:28:26,915 --> 03:28:30,753
It's all right now.

1819
03:29:17,591 --> 03:29:19,927
We've been waiting
for you, Victor.

1820
03:29:20,886 --> 03:29:23,097
My broken boy.

1821
03:29:25,265 --> 03:29:27,518
You don't have to be
alone anymore.

1822
03:29:27,559 --> 03:29:29,311
We'll be together again.

1823
03:29:36,985 --> 03:29:39,238
We can put it back, Vic.

1824
03:29:43,575 --> 03:29:45,828
Make you whole again.

1825
03:29:57,548 --> 03:29:59,299
I'm not broken.

1826
03:30:08,934 --> 03:30:10,978
And I'm not alone.

1827
03:30:27,661 --> 03:30:28,829
Superman!

1828
03:31:59,419 --> 03:32:01,380
I told you

1829
03:32:02,881 --> 03:32:05,551
Steppenwolf would fail.

1830
03:32:06,552 --> 03:32:10,222
Yes. Yes, you did.

1831
03:32:10,806 --> 03:32:12,099
My master,

1832
03:32:12,224 --> 03:32:16,019
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

1833
03:32:16,061 --> 03:32:20,023
how will you retrieve
your great prize?

1834
03:32:20,107 --> 03:32:23,443
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

1835
03:32:23,569 --> 03:32:28,490
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.

1836
03:32:31,618 --> 03:32:33,245
Ready the armada.

1837
03:32:33,996 --> 03:32:36,498
We will use the old ways.

1838
03:35:00,600 --> 03:35:03,103
Your father twice over.

1839
03:35:10,193 --> 03:35:12,738
Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,

1840
03:35:12,821 --> 03:35:14,698
not as a scientist,

1841
03:35:14,740 --> 03:35:16,324
as a father.

1842
03:35:16,450 --> 03:35:19,703
Your father twice over.

1843
03:35:21,955 --> 03:35:25,542
I brought you into the world
and back to it.

1844
03:35:25,625 --> 03:35:29,880
You can't imagine how proud
I am of who you are.

1845
03:35:29,963 --> 03:35:31,673
Have always been.

1846
03:35:33,633 --> 03:35:35,093
So many years with you I wasted.

1847
03:35:35,177 --> 03:35:38,680
So many wrongs
I've left un-righted.

1848
03:35:41,099 --> 03:35:43,310
Everything breaks, Victor.

1849
03:35:43,435 --> 03:35:45,812
Everything changes.

1850
03:35:56,406 --> 03:35:58,617
I gotta go see my father.

1851
03:36:34,152 --> 03:36:36,029
The world is hurt.

1852
03:36:36,154 --> 03:36:37,239
Broken.

1853
03:36:37,364 --> 03:36:39,699
Unexchangeable.

1854
03:36:39,825 --> 03:36:41,701
Ship's all yours now, kid.

1855
03:36:41,827 --> 03:36:43,245
You're the boss.

1856
03:36:45,330 --> 03:36:48,625
"Ryan Choi,
Director of Nanotechnology."

1857
03:36:48,750 --> 03:36:50,335
That's your thing.

1858
03:36:50,919 --> 03:36:52,796
Uh, yep.

1859
03:36:52,879 --> 03:36:54,548
That's my thing.

1860
03:36:59,427 --> 03:37:03,682
But the world's
not fixed in the past,

1861
03:37:03,765 --> 03:37:04,850
only the future.

1862
03:37:06,601 --> 03:37:10,480
The not yet. The now.

1863
03:37:10,605 --> 03:37:14,150
Wow.
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1864
03:37:14,234 --> 03:37:15,694
Must be.

1865
03:37:16,862 --> 03:37:18,363
Big round table.

1866
03:37:18,488 --> 03:37:20,782
Six chairs, right there.

1867
03:37:21,908 --> 03:37:23,577
But room for more.

1868
03:37:25,912 --> 03:37:27,622
But room for more.

1869
03:37:28,665 --> 03:37:30,250
God help us.

1870
03:37:32,085 --> 03:37:34,254
The now is you.

1871
03:37:37,883 --> 03:37:39,175
What?

1872
03:37:39,384 --> 03:37:42,178
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1873
03:37:42,220 --> 03:37:44,764
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

1874
03:37:44,890 --> 03:37:46,558
This is like a "job" job?

1875
03:37:47,225 --> 03:37:48,476
"Job" job.

1876
03:37:52,063 --> 03:37:54,691
Your foot's in the door.

1877
03:37:56,985 --> 03:37:58,069
Isn't that a thing people say?

1878
03:37:58,236 --> 03:38:00,196
Your foot's in the door.

1879
03:38:00,280 --> 03:38:02,574
Yeah, that's something
people say, man.

1880
03:38:02,657 --> 03:38:04,284
His foot's in the door!

1881
03:38:04,409 --> 03:38:07,078
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1882
03:38:07,162 --> 03:38:08,455
Taught him nothing he knows.

1883
03:38:08,580 --> 03:38:09,706
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna

1884
03:38:09,789 --> 03:38:10,790
get maced again.

1885
03:38:14,169 --> 03:38:16,046
No stopping you now.

1886
03:38:18,089 --> 03:38:19,299
Thanks, Dad.

1887
03:38:19,424 --> 03:38:20,675
Now.

1888
03:38:20,800 --> 03:38:23,762
Now's your time, Victor,
to rise.

1889
03:38:23,887 --> 03:38:26,890
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1890
03:38:26,973 --> 03:38:30,644
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.

1891
03:38:40,820 --> 03:38:43,865
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1892
03:38:43,990 --> 03:38:45,951
I bought the bank.

1893
03:38:48,328 --> 03:38:50,914
Congratulations, by the way.

1894
03:38:50,997 --> 03:38:52,582
Do this. Be this.

1895
03:38:52,707 --> 03:38:57,921
The man I never was.
The hero you are.

1896
03:38:57,963 --> 03:39:00,298
Take your place
among the brave ones.

1897
03:39:00,382 --> 03:39:05,679
The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.

1898
03:39:38,253 --> 03:39:41,339
It's time you stand,

1899
03:39:45,010 --> 03:39:46,553
fight,

1900
03:39:49,097 --> 03:39:50,598
discover,

1901
03:39:55,186 --> 03:39:57,480
heal, love,

1902
03:40:00,984 --> 03:40:01,985
win.

1903
03:40:28,470 --> 03:40:30,305
The time

1904
03:40:30,430 --> 03:40:31,890
is now.

1905
03:40:41,066 --> 03:40:42,275
Ready?

1906
03:40:42,400 --> 03:40:43,526
Come on, Stevens.

1907
03:40:47,280 --> 03:40:48,740
All right, let's keep it moving.

1908
03:40:50,492 --> 03:40:51,743
Keep going.

1909
03:40:53,411 --> 03:40:55,413
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1910
03:40:58,958 --> 03:41:00,043
Luthor.

1911
03:41:04,881 --> 03:41:06,049
Open up two, Carl, please.

1912
03:41:15,183 --> 03:41:16,601
Luthor.

1913
03:41:21,481 --> 03:41:22,899
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

1914
03:41:23,024 --> 03:41:24,818
or I'm gonna
have to come in there.

1915
03:42:53,364 --> 03:42:55,491
Ah, there he is.

1916
03:42:56,075 --> 03:42:57,368
Welcome aboard.

1917
03:42:57,452 --> 03:42:59,120
Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?

1918
03:42:59,245 --> 03:43:01,164
I was just celebrating
God's return.

1919
03:43:01,206 --> 03:43:03,708
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1920
03:43:03,791 --> 03:43:06,461
I heard you were
a few clowns short of a circus.

1921
03:43:06,586 --> 03:43:08,129
I was, thank you,

1922
03:43:08,254 --> 03:43:10,506
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

1923
03:43:10,590 --> 03:43:12,717
find some much needed clarity.

1924
03:43:12,800 --> 03:43:15,136
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

1925
03:43:15,261 --> 03:43:16,221
free of charge.

1926
03:43:16,387 --> 03:43:18,181
Why the pro bono work?

1927
03:43:18,223 --> 03:43:20,016
It's personal.

1928
03:43:20,141 --> 03:43:23,186
Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?

1929
03:43:25,104 --> 03:43:26,898
You said you had something
I'd want?

1930
03:43:26,981 --> 03:43:28,524
You'd better not be
wasting my time.

1931
03:43:28,566 --> 03:43:30,693
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

1932
03:43:30,777 --> 03:43:32,612
No, I wouldn't think of it.

1933
03:43:32,737 --> 03:43:33,947
Uh, I have too much to live for.

1934
03:43:34,072 --> 03:43:37,200
And more important things to do.

1935
03:43:37,325 --> 03:43:40,703
But if you want the Batman,

1936
03:43:40,828 --> 03:43:44,082
here is something
that can help you.

1937
03:43:45,416 --> 03:43:49,671
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1938
03:43:52,674 --> 03:43:55,176
Hmm. On second thought,

1939
03:43:57,303 --> 03:43:59,597
we do have something
to celebrate.

1940
03:44:00,473 --> 03:44:02,016
Good boy.

1941
03:45:06,331 --> 03:45:07,665
Clear.

1942
03:45:12,837 --> 03:45:14,672
How much further?

1943
03:45:15,715 --> 03:45:17,008
We're almost there.

1944
03:45:19,010 --> 03:45:20,720
Well, we need to hurry.

1945
03:45:20,845 --> 03:45:22,472
We can't be out in the open
much longer.

1946
03:45:22,555 --> 03:45:24,223
He'll come for us.

1947
03:45:27,060 --> 03:45:29,187
Let him come.

1948
03:45:29,354 --> 03:45:31,022
Let the bastard come.

1949
03:45:32,190 --> 03:45:34,442
I'll stab this through his heart

1950
03:45:34,567 --> 03:45:36,736
for what he did to Arthur.

1951
03:45:36,861 --> 03:45:38,988
I want to make him pay.

1952
03:45:40,365 --> 03:45:43,326
I understand how you feel, Mera.

1953
03:45:43,409 --> 03:45:46,079
You have no idea how I feel.

1954
03:45:46,204 --> 03:45:48,039
But we have to stick to the plan

1955
03:45:48,206 --> 03:45:50,583
to have any chance
to make this right.

1956
03:45:58,466 --> 03:46:01,969
Who have you ever loved?

1957
03:46:15,942 --> 03:46:19,237
Au contraire,
my little fish stick.

1958
03:46:22,865 --> 03:46:24,534
He knows exactly what it's like

1959
03:46:24,575 --> 03:46:26,369
to lose someone he loves.

1960
03:46:28,329 --> 03:46:30,748
You know, like, uh,

1961
03:46:31,791 --> 03:46:33,292
a father,

1962
03:46:34,710 --> 03:46:36,879
like a mother.

1963
03:46:36,963 --> 03:46:40,174
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

1964
03:46:41,759 --> 03:46:43,928
Like an adopted son.

1965
03:46:47,557 --> 03:46:49,225
Isn't that right,

1966
03:46:50,643 --> 03:46:52,228
Batman?

1967
03:46:55,440 --> 03:46:56,774
Maybe, in a way,

1968
03:46:56,858 --> 03:46:58,776
that smelly
old flounder is right.

1969
03:47:00,319 --> 03:47:03,072
Because how many
can die in your arms

1970
03:47:03,156 --> 03:47:04,907
before you grow numb to death?

1971
03:47:06,409 --> 03:47:09,162
That's not very careful.

1972
03:47:09,287 --> 03:47:13,082
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

1973
03:47:13,124 --> 03:47:16,002
before you die inside yourself?

1974
03:47:16,127 --> 03:47:19,839
I've been dead inside
a long time,

1975
03:47:19,964 --> 03:47:21,924
but even I have a limit.

1976
03:47:22,008 --> 03:47:23,843
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

1977
03:47:23,968 --> 03:47:26,846
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

1978
03:47:26,971 --> 03:47:28,973
You won't kill me.

1979
03:47:29,682 --> 03:47:31,767
I'm your best friend.

1980
03:47:31,851 --> 03:47:36,272
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?

1981
03:47:38,316 --> 03:47:39,775
Anyway,

1982
03:47:40,860 --> 03:47:42,445
you need me.

1983
03:47:43,488 --> 03:47:45,239
You

1984
03:47:45,364 --> 03:47:48,201
need me to help you
undo this world

1985
03:47:48,326 --> 03:47:51,204
you created by letting her die.

1986
03:47:53,706 --> 03:47:55,666
Poor Lois.

1987
03:47:55,750 --> 03:47:58,544
How she suffered so!

1988
03:48:04,509 --> 03:48:06,677
I often wonder

1989
03:48:06,844 --> 03:48:08,638
how many alternate timelines

1990
03:48:08,763 --> 03:48:11,098
do you destroy
the world because...

1991
03:48:12,016 --> 03:48:13,643
frankly, you don't have

1992
03:48:13,768 --> 03:48:16,354
the cojones to die yourself.

1993
03:48:17,355 --> 03:48:18,898
Hmm?

1994
03:48:20,858 --> 03:48:22,026
So, as usual,

1995
03:48:22,151 --> 03:48:24,862
I'll be the bigger man.

1996
03:48:28,533 --> 03:48:30,117
A truce,

1997
03:48:30,826 --> 03:48:32,537
Bruce.

1998
03:48:34,872 --> 03:48:39,085
As long as you
have this card, a truce.

1999
03:48:41,963 --> 03:48:42,964
But all you have to do

2000
03:48:43,089 --> 03:48:44,173
is tear it in half

2001
03:48:44,298 --> 03:48:45,716
and I'm happy
to discuss with you

2002
03:48:45,842 --> 03:48:48,427
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

2003
03:48:50,096 --> 03:48:52,098
to do a man's job?

2004
03:48:55,476 --> 03:48:57,144
You know, it's funny

2005
03:48:57,270 --> 03:48:58,729
that you would talk about people

2006
03:48:58,813 --> 03:49:00,314
who died in my arms

2007
03:49:00,439 --> 03:49:02,191
because when I held Harley Quinn

2008
03:49:02,275 --> 03:49:04,861
and she was bleeding and dying,

2009
03:49:04,986 --> 03:49:08,698
she begged me
with her last breath

2010
03:49:08,739 --> 03:49:11,033
that when I killed you,

2011
03:49:11,117 --> 03:49:14,704
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...

2012
03:49:14,787 --> 03:49:16,622
that I'd do it slow.

2013
03:49:17,832 --> 03:49:19,959
I'm gonna honor that promise.

2014
03:49:50,448 --> 03:49:53,284
Oh. You're good.

2015
03:49:57,496 --> 03:49:59,165
You almost had me.

2016
03:50:18,392 --> 03:50:19,644
Where are we holing up?

2017
03:50:19,810 --> 03:50:22,271
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

2018
03:50:22,313 --> 03:50:25,274
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

2019
03:50:25,358 --> 03:50:28,152
What do you think?

2020
03:50:34,075 --> 03:50:35,242
He's found us.

2021
03:52:04,248 --> 03:52:06,792
Can I help you?

2022
03:52:06,917 --> 03:52:10,546
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

2023
03:52:10,588 --> 03:52:13,674
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

2024
03:52:13,799 --> 03:52:16,802
We have to find it
before he does.

2025
03:52:16,927 --> 03:52:18,804
There's a war coming.

2026
03:52:18,929 --> 03:52:20,765
And I'm here to help.

2027
03:52:20,890 --> 03:52:23,100
I'm sorry, who are you again?

2028
03:52:23,225 --> 03:52:25,352
I've gone by many names

2029
03:52:25,478 --> 03:52:28,689
and taken many forms.
And like you,

2030
03:52:28,814 --> 03:52:31,484
I've realized I have
a stake in this world

2031
03:52:31,609 --> 03:52:34,361
and it's time
I started fighting for it.

2032
03:52:34,945 --> 03:52:36,280
Oh.

2033
03:52:37,656 --> 03:52:39,950
Well, we could
definitely use the help.

2034
03:52:40,117 --> 03:52:43,454
So, glad you're here.

2035
03:52:44,455 --> 03:52:45,581
You know, I never thought

2036
03:52:45,623 --> 03:52:46,832
I'd see the defenders of Earth

2037
03:52:46,957 --> 03:52:49,794
united and fighting as one.

2038
03:52:49,877 --> 03:52:52,546
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

2039
03:52:53,756 --> 03:52:56,425
Your mother and father
would be proud.

2040
03:52:57,718 --> 03:52:58,844
I hope so.

2041
03:53:04,934 --> 03:53:07,853
Well, I'll be in touch.

2042
03:53:08,896 --> 03:53:12,983
Oh, and some have called me

2043
03:53:13,109 --> 03:53:15,486
the Martian Manhunter.

2044
03:53:23,077 --> 03:53:25,538
I guess I'll see you around.

2045
03:57:07,885 --> 03:57:12,681
<i>I've heard there was
a secret chord</i>

2046
03:57:12,765 --> 03:57:17,311
<i>That David played
and it pleased the lord</i>

2047
03:57:17,436 --> 03:57:23,025
<i>But you don't really care
for music, do you?</i>

2048
03:57:25,652 --> 03:57:29,198
<i>It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth</i>

2049
03:57:29,281 --> 03:57:33,243
<i>The minor fall
The major lift</i>

2050
03:57:33,327 --> 03:57:41,210
<i>The baffled king
composing hallelujah</i>

2051
03:57:41,293 --> 03:57:45,214
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2052
03:57:45,297 --> 03:57:47,508
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2053
03:57:48,759 --> 03:57:52,679
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2054
03:57:52,805 --> 03:57:58,811
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2055
03:58:00,521 --> 03:58:05,067
<i>Well your faith was strong
but you needed proof</i>

2056
03:58:05,109 --> 03:58:08,654
<i>You saw her bathing
on the roof</i>

2057
03:58:08,779 --> 03:58:11,323
<i>Her beauty and the moonlight</i>

2058
03:58:11,324 --> 03:58:13,867
<i>overthrew you</i>

2059
03:58:16,286 --> 03:58:19,790
<i>She tied you
to her kitchen chair</i>

2060
03:58:19,957 --> 03:58:23,919
<i>She broke your throne
and she cut your hair</i>

2061
03:58:24,002 --> 03:58:31,009
<i>And from your lips
she drew the hallelujah</i>

2062
03:58:31,135 --> 03:58:34,096
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2063
03:58:35,013 --> 03:58:37,641
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2064
03:58:38,642 --> 03:58:42,271
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2065
03:58:42,354 --> 03:58:47,734
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2066
03:58:50,779 --> 03:58:54,992
<i>Hey baby
I've been here before</i>

2067
03:58:55,117 --> 03:58:59,163
<i>I've seen this room
and I've walked this floor</i>

2068
03:58:59,329 --> 03:59:04,168
<i>I used to live alone
before I knew you</i>

2069
03:59:07,171 --> 03:59:10,841
<i>But I've seen your flag
on the marble arch</i>

2070
03:59:10,966 --> 03:59:14,511
<i>And love is not
a victory march</i>

2071
03:59:14,636 --> 03:59:21,894
<i>It's a cold and
it is a broken hallelujah</i>

2072
03:59:22,561 --> 03:59:26,315
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2073
03:59:26,440 --> 03:59:29,067
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2074
03:59:30,360 --> 03:59:34,323
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2075
03:59:34,406 --> 03:59:40,162
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2076
03:59:43,415 --> 03:59:48,045
<i>Well there was a time
when you let me know</i>

2077
03:59:48,128 --> 03:59:52,716
<i>What's really going
on below</i>

2078
03:59:52,883 --> 03:59:58,180
<i>Now you never show
that to me, do you?</i>

2079
04:00:01,058 --> 04:00:04,394
<i>Remember
when i moved in you</i>

2080
04:00:04,478 --> 04:00:08,357
<i>And the holy ghost
was moving too</i>

2081
04:00:08,398 --> 04:00:15,572
<i>And every breath
we drew was hallelujah</i>

2082
04:00:16,406 --> 04:00:20,118
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2083
04:00:20,244 --> 04:00:22,746
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2084
04:00:24,248 --> 04:00:27,709
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2085
04:00:27,793 --> 04:00:34,925
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2086
04:00:49,773 --> 04:00:54,778
<i>Well, maybe there is
a god above</i>

2087
04:00:57,072 --> 04:01:02,160
<i>But all I have
ever learned from love</i>

2088
04:01:03,537 --> 04:01:06,748
<i>Was how to shoot somebody</i>

2089
04:01:07,791 --> 04:01:13,088
<i>Who outdrew you</i>

2090
04:01:13,130 --> 04:01:17,426
<i>It's not a cry
that you hear at night</i>

2091
04:01:17,509 --> 04:01:21,847
<i>And it is not somebody
who's seen the light</i>

2092
04:01:21,972 --> 04:01:23,807
<i>It's a cold</i>

2093
04:01:23,890 --> 04:01:31,273
<i>And it is
a broken hallelujah</i>

2094
04:01:31,356 --> 04:01:34,443
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2095
04:01:34,526 --> 04:01:37,195
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2096
04:01:37,863 --> 04:01:41,450
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2097
04:01:41,533 --> 04:01:48,206
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2098
04:01:48,332 --> 04:01:50,917
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2099
04:01:51,043 --> 04:01:54,713
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2100
04:01:56,506 --> 04:01:58,759
<i>Hallelujah</i>

2101
04:02:00,218 --> 04:02:07,184
<i>Hallelujah</i>
